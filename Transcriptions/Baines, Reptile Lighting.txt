English Version: So, what does a reptile respond to? What does it see? What does it feel? What does its brain and the cells in its body respond to and what has it evolved to benefit from? The answer has to be, it responds to its entire micro-habitat. The first all-in-one bulbs that provide UVB, UV, UVA, visible light, and infrared were mercury vapor lamps. So if we have a look at that, this is the sunlight. This is just the spec, the part with the sunlight up to the end of the red spectrum that we can see. If we put the mercury vapor light on it, you can see that it looks terrible, doesn't it? Yes, it does. It's just a few spikes. That's absolutely typical mercury vapor lamp. They're all like that.

Chinese Version: 那么，爬行动物对什么有反应？它看到了什么？它感觉到了什么？它的大脑和体内的细胞对什么有反应，它又从中获得了什么好处？答案必须是，它对其整个微观生态环境有反应。第一种集UVB、UV、UVA、可见光和红外线于一体的灯泡是汞蒸汽灯。所以，如果我们看看这个，这就是太阳光。这仅仅是太阳光的一部分，是我们可以看到的红光谱的末端。如果我们把汞蒸气灯打开，你会发现它看起来很糟糕，不是吗？是的，它确实如此。它只是几个尖峰。这绝对是典型的汞蒸气灯。所有的汞蒸气灯都是这样。

English Version: Welcome to episode number 104 of the Animals at Home podcast. My name is Dylan Parent. Thank you so much for tuning in. Today we have a very special guest on the podcast. This is an episode that I've been wanting to do for a while now, at least a couple of years. And this guest is probably one of the most recommended or most asked about guests. I get so many messages saying "Hey, are we ever going to have this individual on?" The answer has always been yes, we just sort of been working, waiting to find a time where our schedules match up, and they finally did.

Chinese Version: 欢迎收听《家养动物》播客的第104期。我是Dylan Parent。非常感谢你的收听。今天我们的播客有一位非常特别的嘉宾。这是我一直想做的一个节目，至少已经想做几年了。而这位嘉宾可能是最常被推荐或被询问的嘉宾之一。我收到很多消息说“嘿，我们会邀请这个人上节目吗？”答案一直是肯定的，我们只是在等待，寻找我们的时间表能够匹配的时候，现在终于做到了。

English Version: So joining me on the podcast today is Dr. Francis Baines. I imagine most of you are familiar with who Dr. Baines is, but if you're not, you're about to be. Because this is an incredibly thorough episode. Dr. Baines is, I'm going to use this term, I know she won't want me to, but she is an expert when it comes to reptile lighting. And she is really one of the top experts in herpeticulture when it comes to reptile lighting. She is a vet out of the UK, but she's spent a huge portion of her career studying UV and reptile lighting in general and how important it is to provide optimal lighting for our reptiles.

Chinese Version: 所以今天加入我播客的是弗朗西斯·贝恩斯博士。我想你们大多数人都知道贝恩斯博士是谁，但如果你不知道，你马上就会知道。因为这是一个非常详尽的节目。贝恩斯博士，我要用这个词，我知道她不会希望我这么说，但她在爬行动物照明方面是一个专家。并且她在爬行动物照明方面确实是爬行动物文化中的顶级专家。她是来自英国的兽医，但她在职业生涯中的很大一部分时间都在研究UV和一般意义上的爬行动物照明，以及为我们的爬行动物提供最佳照明的重要性。

1999 my son was 12 and he chose a baby beardy dragon pog well pog was the most beautiful beardy with a huge personality and of course one of each soon became two of each and then we had little menageries and little reptile dynasties but at that time no one gave uvb to leopard geckos but we did diligently buy uvb tubes for the beardies every six months we joined a local group of reptile keepers they met once a month about an hour's drive away and this was called the south wales branch of azra the association for the study of reptiles amphibians that became south wales reptile and exotic animal group when eyes are closed and i was secretary of that group for many years but in 2001 we got our first computer and the internet i mean that was just fatal a few weeks later i came across a brand new forum being set up by three hobbyists so i had no idea who they were their names were gordon stephen mark you know who you are guys if you're watching they named it arc group and ark stood for advanced reptile keepers because we thought we'd do quite a lot in those days and i was literally their first forum member and that was my new career we met in real life at the first ever reptile show i went to in dorset in 2002 and that was where i invested in this really expensive new lamp it was one of the first mercury vapor lamps you could buy and the claims for its output and its longevity i mean you wouldn't believe it was a phenomenal but about a year later our beloved male beardy pog fell only about two feet off his basking branch and he damaged his hip and it turned out he had mvd and i was absolutely appalled and i tried to find out why and to my amazement i discovered that no one not even the manufacturers actually could tell me what uvb output their labs were emitting wow so that was a bit of a shock and of course being me i just thought i'm not having this i'm going to sort this out so i discovered another new forum it was called the uvb meter owners it was an american forum and i learned of something called a solar meter one of these was that a reptile form or was that just something like uvb meters for reptiles yeah okay and it was just starting up people had just heard of these and decided to buy them um they were manufactured originally for tiny lamps this kind of thing and through that form i met an electronics engineer he was also a chameleon specialist his name was andy beveridge and two other friends rob lane and rachel hitch and we imported with a great deal of difficulty the first centimeters into the uk when i got mine i soon discovered that this amazing mercury vapor lamp was indeed amazing but it was amazingly bad and i vowed that i'd test every uvb lamp on sale in the uk well at that time there were only three manufacturers so it didn't seem too big a task but then this guy named bob mccarter from america on the fort through the forum sent me samples of a new invention the mega ray and all the way from north carolina he sent them and he sent a ballast as well so i could use the english voltage with the american map and everything got really busy after that so i guess that's really how i got into looking at reptiles it's a great story and i think i'm sure it must have been because he said you know people were using uv back in the late 90s and mid 90s and whatnot but i'm sure having that experience of measuring that first bulb must have just opened up this giant spider web of confusion and where do we go from here and so so what did you do next once you started testing balls were you like oh right yeah well this is yeah this is really how the uv guide started well i had my three new friends and i created this website called uv guide in 2005 and i can just show you that actually um yeah this is our little website to publish our findings well unfortunately that that little website hasn't been updated for years i've just never had time to do it but that was the beginning and andy beveridge then gave me his spectrometer on semi-permanent loan well i'd never seen a spectrometer i didn't know anything about it but he taught me how to use it well the other two in the group kind of moved on to other things but andy and i kept on testing and we even took the meters and the spectrometer on field trips and this is us in mindo cloud forest in ecuador and we're taking a spectrum of the light in the in the um in the canopy under the canopy and um it was a wonderful holiday that was we went to galapagos and this is me in nolanji in kakadu in australia and after that for every holiday i went i was an absolute nightmare because i was forever going stop the car when you take a uv lifting every hour so i look at my watch and i say need time to stop for another reason but you know you get you get really excited about these things well i do and you got to get that data and that's the thing is back then it was understood that you needed to be there but there was just no data behind it right it was just by your bulb and then that was it yeah and of course in 2006 we got these we got the uv index meters which made a huge difference right um but you know back to the story if i just um stop that um well um andy introduced me to the british and irish association of zoos and aquaria biazer for short and the zoo world and zookeeper douglas sheriff who was then at chester zoo had been working a lot with uv when he invited me to present our work at my first zookeepers conference which was a black pool zoo in 2005. um and maybe it wouldn't have gone much further but between 2006 and 2007 a lot of the reptile supply companies were jumping on the bandwagon and trying to provide ever stronger uvb lamps and there came up a problem with lamps from several of the major manufacturers um supplying they were causing uvb burns to eyes and skin and a horrifying 10 death rate in younger animals wow no one could work out why because the total uvb readings with the uv meters were quite low but there were some amazing people on the forums across the world and i started collecting case histories from them and they even sent me samples of the lamps and there was one american forum radiosliders.com i think that's right and they they produced a dossier of all the lamps that they had problems with and they then sent a whole box full of these lamps right across the pond for me to test well with the help of the spectrometer and the uv index meter what i discovered was that they were all emitting unnaturally short wavelengths uvb which isn't found in sunlight but not uvc but only tiny amounts of this short wavelengths uvb could could burn the eyes well the companies did believe all the reports we sent and the affected lamps were withdrawn and they realized what the problem was and after that they started getting me to screen their prototype replacements which was quite amazing really and then other companies started sending me samples to test for them too and it was like the business took off um but in june 2007 the curator at zsl london zoo richard gibson invited me to join the biazer reptile and amphibian working group we called it rogue and he insisted i become an appointed advisor on lighting for the uk zoos well the following year they set up a uv focus group and i was asked to be coordinator of the group and at first i was really daunted because i was really new to the zoo world but they wanted us to create a guide to the use of ub with reptiles and amphibians in zoos and it was to be called a uv tool this uv tool i discovered i had this remarkable team it was spread across six zoos and they were really supportive and they were keen to work on the products and we worked on it for several years we based it on some pioneering work by professor gary ferguson and his team at texas christian university and they were way ahead of us they were measuring the uv in natural exposure of reptiles they were following them around in the wild in america and in jamaica and places like that and we had many long email conversations with gary and his colleague dr william german and it was wonderful to learn from them they drafted a set of guidelines for uv exposure based on their research they published it in 2010 and they encouraged us to adapt it for use in the uk zoos so we did and i said well i think it should be called the ferguson zones they're they're uv zones in honour of their inventor and the name caught on straight away and we launched the first version of the piazza uv tool in november 2012. so you actually named the ferguson zones you came up with that name well yeah i did that's awesome well gary wasn't very keen on it to start with you can't just we had contributions from 15 zoos and then we had about i don't know about 11 independent contributors and some of them i expect if you look at the names i expect some of the names are familiar wonderful project um and it's been updated several times it's now got estimates they are estimates for the suitable ranges of uv for about 266 species wow and it was published in the peer review journal uh journal of zoo and aquarium research or jsar in 2016 and i expect you'll probably have seen um simplified versions of it popping up that's appeared in several magazines and versions of it in websites and as you've turned up in the chapters and a couple of veterinary textbooks well the raw group have carried on working quite actively ever since and we've delivered and developed things like uv lighting systems for huge enclosures you can see here you've got a huge area of uv about five four five meters across for the tortoises with these high output t5 tubes you've got metal halides for the visible light and you've got infrared heaters the patio lamps for for the infrared and these have worked really well quite a lot of the zoos are using these now it's quite exciting and we developed things like methods for conducting lighting audits and care guides and uh looked at those heaters and this is our rogue members annual meeting that was the last one before the covered lockdown that was may 2019 at marwell zoo and we ran a lighting workshop there well that september i was able to meet gary ferguson in person we went to the ahh meeting in rodeo in new mexico where he was our keynote speaker and it was a special occasion for me as you can imagine here's gary with me and my friend and colleague ron murin and his wife judy dylan's interviewed you've interviewed uh rom haven't you so yes yeah rahm's been on the show yeah so that's all how how it came about really um that's amazing it's amazing to think how much we almost take for granted now as far as uv

Role: assistant
In 1999, my son, who was 12 at the time, chose a baby bearded dragon named Pog. Pog was a beautiful creature with a huge personality. Soon, one bearded dragon became two, and we ended up with a small menagerie of reptiles. At that time, no one provided UVB light to leopard geckos, but we diligently purchased UVB tubes for the bearded dragons every six months. We joined a local group of reptile keepers, the South Wales Branch of the Association for the Study of Reptiles and Amphibians, which later became the South Wales Reptile and Exotic Animal Group. I served as the secretary of this group for many years.

在1999年，我的儿子12岁时选择了一只名叫Pog的小胡须龙。Pog是一只美丽的生物，性格大大的。很快，一个胡须龙变成了两个，我们最后养了一小群爬行动物。那时，没有人为豹纹守宫提供UVB光，但我们每六个月为胡须龙购买一次UVB灯管。我们加入了一个当地的爬行动物饲养者团队，即南威尔士爬行动物和两栖动物研究协会分会，后来成为南威尔士爬行动物和异国动物团队。我在这个团队中担任了多年的秘书。

In 2001, we got our first computer and internet access. This was a game-changer. A few weeks later, I came across a new forum set up by three hobbyists named Gordon, Stephen, and Mark. They named it the ARC group, which stood for Advanced Reptile Keepers. I was their first forum member and that started my new career. We met in real life at the first-ever reptile show I attended in Dorset in 2002. There, I invested in an expensive new mercury vapor lamp, one of the first of its kind available for purchase. However, about a year later, our beloved male bearded dragon Pog fell from his basking branch and damaged his hip. It turned out he had MBD and I was appalled.

在2001年，我们买了第一台电脑并接入了互联网。这是一个游戏规则的改变者。几周后，我在网上找到了一个由三个爱好者Gordon、Stephen和Mark新建的论坛。他们将其命名为ARC团队，代表高级爬行动物饲养者。我成为他们的首位论坛成员，这开启了我新的事业。我们在2002年我参加的第一次爬行动物展览会上真实地相遇，那是在多塞特。在那里，我投资购买了一盏昂贵的新型汞蒸气灯，这是首批可供购买的此类产品之一。然而，大约一年后，我们心爱的雄性胡须龙Pog从他的晒太阳的树枝上摔下来，损伤了他的臀部。结果发现他得了MBD，我感到震惊。

I tried to find out why Pog had MBD and to my astonishment, I discovered that no one, not even the manufacturers, could tell me what UVB output their lamps were emitting. This was a shock. I joined another new forum, the UVB Meter Owners, an American forum where I learned about a device called a solar meter. Through this forum, I met an electronics engineer and chameleon specialist named Andy Beveridge and two other friends, Rob Lane and Rachel Hitch. We imported the first solar meters into the UK with a great deal of difficulty. When I tested the mercury vapor lamp with my new solar meter, I found that it was indeed amazing, but in a bad way. I vowed to test every UVB lamp on sale in the UK.

我试图找出Pog为何得了MBD，令我震惊的是，我发现没有人，甚至连制造商都不能告诉我他们的灯泡发出了多少UVB。这是个震惊。我加入了另一个新论坛，美国的UVB计量器所有者论坛，在那里我了解到一种叫做太阳计的设备。通过这个论坛，我遇到了一位名叫Andy Beveridge的电子工程师和变色龙专家，以及另外两位朋友Rob Lane和Rachel Hitch。我们费尽周折将第一批太阳计导入英国。当我用我的新太阳计测试汞蒸气灯时，我发现它确实令人惊奇，但是以一种糟糕的方式。我发誓要测试英国市场上出售的每一盏UVB灯。

Then, a man named Bob MacCarter from America sent me samples of a new invention, the Mega-Ray, all the way from North Carolina. He also sent a ballast so I could use the English voltage with the American lamp. Things got really busy after that. This is how I got into studying reptiles. Having the experience of measuring that first bulb opened up a giant spider web of confusion. This is how the UV Guide started. I created a website called UV Guide in 2005 to publish our findings. Unfortunately, this website hasn't been updated for years due to lack of time.

然后，一个来自美国的叫Bob MacCarter的人从北卡罗来纳州寄给我一种新发明的样品，名叫Mega-Ray。他还寄来一个镇流器，这样我就可以用英国的电压来使用美国的灯。之后的事情变得非常忙碌。这就是我开始研究爬行动物的原因。测量第一只灯泡的经验打开了一张巨大的蜘蛛网，充满了困惑。这就是UV指南开始的地方。2005年，我创建了一个叫做UV指南的网站来发布我们的发现。不幸的是，由于时间不足，这个网站已经多年未更新。

Andy Beveridge gave me his spectrometer on semi-permanent loan and taught me how to use it. We continued testing and even took the meters and the spectrometer on field trips. We visited places like the Mindo Cloud Forest in Ecuador and Nolanji in Kakadu, Australia. For every holiday after that, I was constantly measuring UV readings every hour. In 2006, we got the UV index meters, which made a huge difference.

Andy Beveridge将他的分光仪半永久地借给我，并教我如何使用它。我们继续测试，甚至带着仪表和分光仪去实地考察。我们参观了像厄瓜多尔的明多云林和澳大利亚的诺兰吉这样的地方。从那次假期开始，我每小时都在不断地测量UV读数。2006年，我们得到了UV指数仪，这带来了巨大的变化。

Andy introduced me to the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) and the zoo world. Douglas Sheriff, who was then at Chester Zoo, had been working a lot with UV when he invited me to present our work at my first zookeepers' conference in Blackpool Zoo in 2005. Between 2006 and 2007, many reptile supply companies tried to provide stronger UVB lamps. However, these lamps were causing UVB burns to eyes and skin, and a horrifying 10% death rate in young animals.

Andy将我介绍给了英国和爱尔兰动物园和水族馆协会（BIAZA）和动物园界。Douglas Sheriff当时在切斯特动物园工作，他在UV方面做了很多工作，他邀请我在2005年在布莱克浦动物园举行的我的第一次饲养员会议上展示我们的工作。在2006年和2007年期间，许多爬行动物供应公司试图提供更强的UVB灯。然而，这些灯导致了UVB对眼睛和皮肤的烧伤，以及年轻动物中可怕的10%的死亡率。

No one could work out why because the total UVB readings with the UV meters were quite low. I started collecting case histories from people on forums across the world. They sent me samples of the lamps and I discovered that they were all emitting unnaturally short wavelengths of UVB, which isn't found in sunlight. The companies believed the reports we sent and the affected lamps were withdrawn. They then started getting me to screen their prototype replacements. Other companies also started sending me samples to test for them too.

没有人能找出原因，因为UV计量器的总UVB读数相当低。我开始从世界各地的论坛上的人们那里收集案例历史。他们寄给我灯泡的样品，我发现它们都在发射不自然的短波长UVB，这在阳光中是找不到的。公司们相信我们发出的报告，受影响的灯泡被撤下。然后他们开始让我筛选他们的原型替代品。其他公司也开始给我寄样品让我为他们测试。

In June 2007, Richard Gibson, the curator at ZSL London Zoo, invited me to join the BIAZA Reptile and Amphibian Working Group. The following year, they set up a UV Focus Group and I was asked to be

murin and his wife judy dylan's interviewed you've interviewed uh rom haven't you so yes yeah rahm's been on the show yeah so that's all how how it came about really um that's amazing it's amazing to think how much we almost take for granted now as far as uv goes it's like we all know where to go for the ferguson zones look what we're trying to get and you know use your meter to get the basking zone correct and it's sort of amazing how absent the information was in the 2000s and and how everybody was just sort of testing you know you buy a bulb and hopefully it works the bulbs that were producing the shortwave uvb were those coil bulbs or those actually like t8 tubes as well it was all of them it was it was the whole range because they were using a different phosphor um and they were using different glass and it was letting through the shorter wavelengths right down to ubc but the companies now have really worked hard on it and and it's quite rare there are still a few random small chinese companies still producing ones that come out with bad spectra but they're quite rare now and it's usually prototypes from a small company that wants to get involved with uv producing big companies are pretty well aware of what they're looking for and some of them have even developed um they've even bought spectrometers which is really exciting encouraging yeah it's really amazing how far that's come even in the last decade then it's just sort of ramped up really quickly well why don't we jump into some of the more specifics with this because you know one of the areas that i've been seeing now is it sort of seems like there's two schools of thought beginning to form especially as technology develops and we have more access to led bulbs which can be a lot tighter on the on the spectrum production i see one school of thought that says we should we should try to strive to provide the full solar spectrum as much as we can as much as the bulbs make it possible and then there's another school of thought that seems like we can use tighter bandwidths to provide the bands that we think are beneficial so you know a tight band for uvb product our first d3 synthesis and and whatever you know basically picking and choosing wavelengths of energy for the animal we don't have to have the full spectrum we can just have this sort of you know patches of it so i was curious what your thoughts on there if you've noticed that as well and where do you sit on that school of thought yes definitely i think it's a really good question because people often tackle me on very specific issues they know nearly always related to just one tiny part of the sun spectrum like the exact wavelengths involved in vitamin d synthesis or the exact wavelengths that cue the brain about day length and that's i think because as human beings really we're very good at putting things into categories and getting very specific so we get you know this is what causes that or we need this to get that and we divide everything up so we say this is blue and that is green he is welsh i'm english these reptiles are diurnal and these are not well we don't like the distinctions to blur and sometimes we don't even have words for it um i mean for example we say blue green we don't really have a word for the intermediate we say somebody's half welsh and half english well we do have cathemeral so that's that's something but um i think what it's meant is that we've separated heat from light from uv and we've even split these into subdivisions i mean don't get me started there's uvb va infrared a b c there's blue light green light red and we've discovered they all do different things which i mean perhaps we can talk about that a bit later on but but i mean if we look at this guy um um this is a little nail monitor that we met in kruger national park in south africa so what does a reptile respond to what does it see what does it feel what does its brain and the cells in its body respond to and what has it evolved to benefit from and the answer has to be it responds to its entire micro habitat everything around it everything plays at least some role in its life it's basically it's holistic and i think that's something that humans are terrible at so it's responding to the whole of the sun spectrum from uvb to infrared b in its national proportions and amounts in the place where it evolved so the lizard the turtle the snake it's not splitting up light from heat or uv from light because sunlight is providing all those things together in proportion with each other so its instincts are responding to signals from one part of the spectrum it may be obtaining benefits from all the rest so if we look at that young nile monitor he's waking up he sees a sunlit patch of rock and he goes there just because he knows it will feel good so there he's absorbing energy from the invisible infrared and from the light and it's warming him up so we say he's thermoregulating but what he's actually doing is absorbing all the wavelengths in the sunlight and they all have different functions as well as supplying warmth i mean the obvious example is that uvb is enabling vitamin d synthesis in his skin well his skin has evolved to the right thickness and the right color to absorb the right amount of uvb in the time he would normally spend in either direct sun or daylight each day and vitamin d synthesis being a two-stage process it also requires warmth so at the same time that the uv is converting the cholesterol in his skin to pre-d3 the warmth is converting the pre-d3 to vitamin d3 so you say well how long is he going to bask for well he controls the time he spends in the sunlight by a temperature sensitive cells in his brain in the how in the hypothalamus but also temperature scented nerve endings in his skin and also in various organs of his body like just around the heart and these are responding to heat generated from short wavelength infrared in sunlight that reaches him directly as well as to warmth conducted from the skin surface and he's sitting on the rock and it's all part of that same continuous spectrum everything's interlinked and every year we keep finding new things that reveal yet more complexity it gets more and more complicated and my my lectures get longer and longer and the importance of not just individual parts of the spectrum but also their intensity and their relationship to each other and if we've got a minute i'll just i'll just show you some spectra yeah this is the spectrum of sunlight um the earth's atmosphere filters out all the very short wavelength stuff that's in this direction and it just lets through some a little bit of uvb from about 295 millimeters this wavelength upwards just a little bit of uvb a lot more uva absolute flood shed loads of visible light a lot of infrared a and a little bit of infrared b so life on earth evolved under all of this and it's evolved to use every bit of it that it can in all the different biochemical ways it's it's a continuum it's like a flood of energy and i think messing up this relationship and splitting up heat light and uv artificially by using lamps that are spread out or only producing short wavelengths can lead to some really weird abnormal effects and there's some quite good experiments actually that have been done over the years um for example there was a trial done with wall lizards padarkis muralis what they did was they warmed the floor of a cage to a set temperature and then they shot a narrow beam of light onto one area one little sort of circle they filtered it to remove the infrared wavelengths so it wasn't strong enough to cause any detectable change in the surface temperature in that little circle and they found that the lizards positioned themselves really accurately with their backs under the center of the beam although it was no warmer there than anywhere else now ron murin has just done some trials with collared lizards and he's found something very similar and if you go to his link on the reptile lighting form you can watch this little video and what he did was he tried um three different basking areas and he had the same uv for all of them and he had all the basking surface temperatures which was there there and they're exactly the same at 32 degrees and in one he had a dhp a d peach projector in one he had a halogen and one he had an led and he timelapsed them and measured how much time they spent and you can just about see on here you've got the collared lizards tending to go to the led or the halogen and mostly the led and so what it looks like is that the these sun the sun basking animals are going for the light they're going for what they perceive as a patch of sunlight although the warmth is the same on all of them well there was another study done earlier a peer-reviewed study which um which i can show you um it was using two species of animals one species was sunbursters the crystallitis and the second were thermoconformers the gunglachi and they kept the whole cage at the either at the preferred body temperature or slightly too warm or slightly too cold but the cage was half illuminated so half of it was shaded and half was not but the temperature inside was the same and the sun basking species they associated brightness with warmth so if the whole cage was cold they went and sat in the lighted area if the whole cage was too hot they all sat in the shaded area although the temperatures were completely the same all the way across but the thermo conformers didn't seem to care they just sat anywhere because they didn't show that preference so they weren't using sunlight as an indicator of heat presumably because in the areas where they live the sunlight isn't producing hot sunbeams that then they don't bask so it's so it's quite interesting to find that different species going to vary but they're all using their environment to decide what they do but it's actually more complicated even than that because when we set up our lamps we always say you know we should have the bright light over the basking zone and that will make a little patch of sunlight but people say well why do you have to do that you know they put the light down one end of the uv up the other end well there was a really good study done with torquay geckos which were the nocturnal ones of course and what they did they set up the first test very much like the previous ones they had a heater down one end with the bright light and a shield so that it wasn't the light that was causing the warmth and they put the tokyo geckos in there and they found that over 24 hours with the light going on and going off again the geckos had a kind of a circadian rhythm in preferred body temperature so they would change their body temperature day and night and the most precise thermo regulation they were doing during the night when they were active which is kind of what you'd expect but when

Murin and his wife Judy Dylan were interviewed. "You've interviewed Rahm, haven't you?" "Yes, Rahm's been on the show. That's how it all came about, really." It's amazing to think how much we almost take for granted now as far as UV goes. We all know where to go for the Ferguson zones, what we're trying to get, and how to use our meter to get the basking zone correct. It's sort of amazing how absent the information was in the 2000s and how everybody was just sort of testing. You buy a bulb and hopefully, it works. The bulbs that were producing the shortwave UVB were those coil bulbs or those actually like T8 tubes as well? It was all of them. They were using a different phosphor and they were using different glass, and it was letting through the shorter wavelengths right down to UBC.

穆林和他的妻子朱迪·迪伦接受了采访。"你采访过拉姆，对吗？""是的，拉姆上过节目。这就是事情的经过。"现在我们对紫外线的理解几乎是理所当然的，这真是令人惊奇。我们都知道去哪里寻找弗格森区，我们想得到什么，以及如何使用我们的仪表来正确地调整晒日光浴区。回想起二十世纪初，这些信息是多么的缺乏，每个人都在试探。你买一个灯泡，希望它能工作。那些产生短波紫外线的灯泡是螺旋灯泡还是T8管灯？其实都有。他们使用了不同的磷光粉，并使用了不同的玻璃，这让更短的波长透过，一直到UBC。

The companies now have really worked hard on it and it's quite rare. There are still a few random small Chinese companies still producing ones that come out with bad spectra, but they're quite rare now. It's usually prototypes from a small company that wants to get involved with UV producing. Big companies are pretty well aware of what they're looking for, and some of them have even developed spectrometers, which is really exciting. It's really amazing how far that's come even in the last decade. Then it's just sort of ramped up really quickly.

现在的公司都在这方面下了很大的工夫，这已经相当罕见了。仍然有一些小型的中国公司在生产那些光谱不好的产品，但现在这样的公司已经很少了。通常是一些想要参与紫外线生产的小公司的原型产品。大公司非常清楚他们在寻找什么，有些甚至开发了光谱仪，这真的非常令人兴奋。即使在过去的十年里，这方面的进步也是惊人的。然后，它就迅速地发展起来了。

Why don't we jump into some of the more specifics with this because one of the areas that I've been seeing now is it sort of seems like there's two schools of thought beginning to form, especially as technology develops and we have more access to LED bulbs, which can be a lot tighter on the spectrum production. I see one school of thought that says we should try to strive to provide the full solar spectrum as much as we can, as much as the bulbs make it possible. Then there's another school of thought that seems like we can use tighter bandwidths to provide the bands that we think are beneficial. So, you know, a tight band for UVB product, our first D3 synthesis, and whatever. Basically picking and choosing wavelengths of energy for the animal. We don't have to have the full spectrum, we can just have this sort of patches of it. So I was curious about your thoughts on this, if you've noticed that as well, and where do you sit on that school of thought?

我们为什么不深入一些具体的细节呢？因为我现在看到的一个领域，似乎有两种思想开始形成，特别是随着技术的发展，我们有了更多接触LED灯泡的机会，这可以在光谱产生上更为紧凑。我看到一种观点是我们应该尽可能提供完整的太阳光谱，只要灯泡能够做到。然后还有另一种观点，我们可以使用更紧的带宽来提供我们认为有益的波段。所以，你知道，一个紧密的UVB产品带宽，我们的第一个D3合成，等等。基本上是为动物挑选和选择能量波长。我们不必拥有完整的光谱，我们可以只有这样的光谱片段。所以，我很好奇你对此的想法，你是否也注意到了这一点，你在这个问题上的立场是什么？

Yes, definitely. I think it's a really good question because people often tackle me on very specific issues. They're nearly always related to just one tiny part of the sun's spectrum like the exact wavelengths involved in vitamin D synthesis or the exact wavelengths that cue the brain about day length. That's because, as human beings, we're very good at putting things into categories and getting very specific. We get, you know, this is what causes that, or we need this to get that, and we divide everything up. We say this is blue and that is green. He is Welsh, I am English. These reptiles are diurnal and these are not. We don't like the distinctions to blur, and sometimes we don't even have words for it.

是的，绝对的。我认为这是一个非常好的问题，因为人们经常在非常具体的问题上和我较劲。他们几乎总是只关注太阳光谱中的一小部分，比如参与维生素D合成的确切波长，或者提示大脑关于昼夜长度的确切波长。这是因为，作为人类，我们非常擅长将事物归类并变得非常具体。我们会说，这是导致那个的原因，或者我们需要这个来得到那个，我们将一切划分开来。我们说这是蓝色的，那是绿色的。他是威尔士人，我是英国人。这些爬行动物是白天活动的，那些不是。我们不喜欢模糊的区分，有时我们甚至没有词语来表达它。

off again the geckos had a kind of a circadian rhythm in preferred body temperature so they would change their body temperature day and night and the most precise thermo regulation they were doing during the night when they were active which is kind of what you'd expect but when the bright light was positioned over the wrong end over the cold end which is a very odd place for the for the light to be what happened then was that the geckos lowered their body temperature all together and they lost the circadian rhythm they also thermoregulated less precisely at night so it was almost as if they were sensing there was no warmth in the sun anymore and that was changing the way they were regulated well in a third scenario they put a uniform gentle light over the whole area to see what they would do and they discovered it was very much like the first one where the light was at one end they still had their daily rhythms on and off and didn't face them at all but the cruelest thing was that this group of of researchers sievert and hutchinson they then did it with colored lizards and these are diurnal species completely different and they found that they lost their natural rhythmic swings when the uniform lighting they were given there wasn't any basking lamp there was there was no sun patch wow so what does that tell us about our bavarian lighting and how important it is to get it right to recreate the natural situation for the animal as best we can and they also were also studies have done when daylink has changed that also alters the preferred body temperatures and the basking preferences because day length changes with seasons and so do reptile behaviors it's like they're hardwired to the patterns of sunlight that they would have experienced as they evolved over days and over the years that is incredible it's it's amazing how much you could mess it up by really like how how long you can get it well yeah and and we're learning you know we always talk about putting the lights in a certain place and and that but it really is it really makes a difference and i think we've only talked about separating light and infrared um experiments have been done with different different parts of the visible light different coloured light on basking there was another experiment done with the wall lizards and they kept the temperature constant but the visible light started off with being white light and then they changed it by putting filters across to remove parts of the spectrum and first of all they removed any blue light below 48 nanometers so there's still a tiny bit of sort of turquoisey blue but most of the blue had gone and of course the uva wasn't there in the first place and then they removed the blue and the green so it leaves a little bit of green but mostly the oranges and reds and what they discovered that when they just removed the blue wavelengths this one it it left a sort of greenish yellow light to our eyes we don't quite know what color it was to the lizards but they didn't change their thermoregulating behavior much at all they didn't change the rate of warming they didn't change the amount of time they spent basking but when they removed the blue and most of the green leaving the yellow orange and red the lizards reduced their preferred body temperature they reduced their rate of heat gain and they basked for longer so the color of the light the lack of these wavelengths changed the way they behaved wow and when you think the way we light our animals you know it really we don't know this we we just don't well the authors of the study what they did was they speculated that blue light is the strongest inhibitor of melatonin so the effect could be due to the removal of the blue wavelengths allowing the brain to synthesize melatonin and that hormone has powerful effects on daily rhythms and it does include thermoregulation in in reptiles well i think the relevance to this in real life is that when the sun is low in the sky as it is in sunrise sunset and all day in the winter in higher latitudes there's less blue in the sunlight and at night of course there's none so blue is a very important wavelength for modifying circadian seasonal rhythms because it acts as a really powerful signal to the brain saying it's daytime so i think these are just a couple of examples i mean sunlight and its effects can't really be separated up into heat light and uv we haven't even mentioned uv yet um what's more that the sun spectrum has very specific amounts of each wavelength all of which are used for something by the body and all of which vary with time of day time of year and we only know some of those uses we keep finding more and the questions are still just as relevant as they've always been how much of each wavelength does each species need does the amount vary with season does it vary with time of day we haven't any clear answers we haven't even any clear answers for the way that um uv we just have crude estimates for the uv and certainly only crude estimates for the temperature which is not even the same as the infrared and we have almost nothing for visible light at all because no one's gone out there and measured it in the wild right so we can't really pull apart the spectrum and provide these important spikes of energy because the only thing we can deduce from the evidence we're collecting is that it's all important right every time we look into something we find another piece of importance and i think we really we do need to reproduce it as faithfully as we can um but it is actually really difficult because not only is this sunlight a continuum from uvb right through to infrared it's also changing from dawn to dusk from winter to summer from full sun to full shade and it's changing in spectrum as well as intensity so it's a big puzzle it really is yeah it absolutely is and as you look into it further you realize how complicated and it sort of reminds me of almost like the difference between eastern and western medicine you know eastern medicine is a lot more holistic they will provide like an herb or a plant and you take the whole thing where western medicine goes okay what alkaloid in that plant is usable and we turn that into a pill where the eastern medicine says no you have to have the whole plant the whole plant is important and i think that's a decent analogy for what we're kind of doing here yeah as long as as long as we don't end up thinking we can use body parts of animals for correct yes yes yeah exactly yeah there's there's certain parts of eastern medicine that we want to stay away from but uh so as far as i know yeah you what you mean is the holistic side of it we're beginning to understand it um there's aspects in medicine which are getting better but that's beside the point is tip for what we're talking about so as far as replicating the sunlight goes how how do we do this what as far as right now because even listening to you talking about you know the different levels of visible light someone could go to the dollar store and buy a cheap led bulb and who knows what that light is giving off of and then who knows what result that it's doing to your animal so what is the best best method for attempting to do this where the technology is right now well i think it was originally everyone wanted to get an all-in-one bulb it was like the holy grail wasn't it that you'd have an all-in-one that would do uv heat and light but our current attempts haven't been very successful and i think it'll be a long time before we can offer a really good sunlight simulator i think our current mix and match solutions are probably even better than a single lap would be too because then we can blend different spectrum we can vary the intensities of each so they give us more flexibility and they give us more control and i i think i can show you what i mean by showing you the different spectra because people don't really don't really often see this so and i think it's it's really interesting so here's our solar spectrum and this is really the holy grail so to start with let's look at the part with the uvb and the visible light so it's this part here the first all-in-one bulbs that provide uvb uv uva visible light and infrared were mercury vapor lamps so if we have a look at that this is the sunlight this is just the spec the part with the sunlight up to the end of the red spectrum that we can see if we put the mercury vapor light on it you can see that it looks terrible doesn't it yes it does it's just it's just a few spikes that's absolutely typical mercury vapor lamp they're all like that exactly virtually exactly the same because that's how much your vapor works and you've got the light looks a bit green to us and it renders colors really badly because our eyes have to kind of work out in our brains what those spikes are going to look out look like in the in the wild we have no idea what that looks like to a reptile right and it's spiky even in the uv range and it can't be dimmed it can't be thermostatically controlled and the other problem with mercury vapor is that they have very narrow beams so many brands do anyway so it only covers like a small circle and it's the other problem which is actually the biggest problem probably is that many brands are impossible to make with a consistent output so you can get two identical bulbs in identical boxes you take them out and you test them and they're giving totally different amounts of uvb well so they they saved thousands of animals and you know they've been wonderful lamps but there are now much better things i think well the successes in human lighting situations were metal halides and you can see straight away there's a good metal halide for humans like this phillips one you've got a much more realistic looking solar spectrum really it sort of mirrors it almost you've got masses of uva you've got quite a lot of all the colors in a continuous spectrum it's spiky because there are lots of different chemicals involved but it adds up to quite a good a good spectrum and in europe they're very widely used over bavarians um they have an extremely bright clean white light and i think they're probably the best some assimilator in the visible range and you can get versions now with uvb for reptiles and in the usa zoo med exoterra have versions and in europe there are a lot of brands and in fact there's even a mega ray in europe which which is a metal halide and you can see now it's producing uv uh uvb as well um but they've never been possible really to to get them popular in the uk or the usa and i think it's probably because they need external ballasts also they're like mercury vapors they can't be dimmed they can't put on a thermostat and they have the same problem they vary a lot in their uvb output they tend to have narrow beams and the ones designed for reptiles tend to lose their uvb fairly rapidly

The geckos exhibited a circadian rhythm in preferred body temperature, altering their body temperature between day and night. The most precise thermoregulation occurred during the night when they were active, which is what would be expected. However, when a bright light was placed at the cold end of their enclosure, an unusual position for the light, the geckos lowered their body temperature overall and lost their circadian rhythm. They also thermoregulated less precisely at night. It was as if they sensed there was no warmth in the sun anymore, and it altered the way they regulated their body temperature.

壁虎表现出了对体温的昼夜节律偏好，白天和黑夜间改变他们的体温。最精确的体温调节发生在他们活跃的夜晚，这是我们所期望的。然而，当一个明亮的灯被放置在他们生活环境的冷端，也就是灯光的位置不寻常，壁虎们总体上降低了他们的体温并且失去了他们的昼夜节律。他们在夜晚也不再精确地调节体温。这就好像他们感觉到太阳中再也没有温暖，这改变了他们调节体温的方式。

In a third scenario, the researchers placed a uniform, gentle light over the whole area to observe the geckos' reactions. They discovered that the geckos' behavior was very similar to the first scenario where the light was at one end. The geckos still had their daily rhythms and the light didn't affect them at all. However, the most surprising finding was when the researchers, Sievert and Hutchinson, conducted the same experiment with colored lizards, a diurnal species completely different from geckos. They found that these lizards lost their natural rhythmic swings when exposed to the uniform lighting.

在第三个场景中，研究者在整个区域放置了一个均匀、温和的灯光，以观察壁虎的反应。他们发现壁虎的行为与第一个场景，即灯光在一端的情况非常相似。壁虎仍然有他们的日常节律，灯光根本不影响他们。然而，最令人惊讶的发现是当研究者Sievert和Hutchinson对彩色蜥蜴进行了同样的实验，这是一种与壁虎完全不同的日行性物种。他们发现，这些蜥蜴在均匀照明的影响下失去了他们的自然节律摆动。

So, what does this tell us about our lighting and its importance in recreating a natural environment for these animals? Other studies have shown that changes in daylight also alter the preferred body temperatures and basking preferences of reptiles. This is because the length of daylight changes with the seasons, and so do reptile behaviors. It's as if they're hardwired to the patterns of sunlight that they would have experienced as they evolved over days and years. It's amazing how much you could mess it up by altering the duration and intensity of light.

那么，这告诉我们什么关于我们的照明以及在为这些动物重建自然环境中的重要性呢？其他研究已经显示，日光的变化也会改变爬行动物的体温和晒太阳的偏好。这是因为白天的长度随着季节的变化而变化，爬行动物的行为也是如此。就好像他们被硬编码到他们在数天和数年的进化过程中所经历的阳光模式中。如果改变光的持续时间和强度，你可能会破坏它。

Experiments have been done with different parts of the visible light, different colored light on basking. There was an experiment done with wall lizards where the temperature was kept constant, but the visible light started off being white light. Then, filters were used to remove parts of the spectrum. First, they removed any blue light below 48 nanometers, leaving a tiny bit of turquoise blue but most of the blue had gone. Then, they removed the blue and the green, leaving a little bit of green but mostly the oranges and reds. When they just removed the blue wavelengths, it left a sort of greenish-yellow light to our eyes. But when they removed the blue and most of the green, leaving the yellow, orange, and red, the lizards reduced their preferred body temperature, reduced their rate of heat gain, and basked for longer. The color of the light, the lack of these wavelengths, changed the way they behaved.

已经进行了关于可见光的不同部分，不同颜色的光对晒太阳的影响的实验。有一个实验是针对壁蜥蜴进行的，其中温度保持恒定，但可见光最初是白光。然后，他们使用过滤器去除光谱的部分。首先，他们去除了48纳米以下的任何蓝光，留下了一点点的青蓝色，但大部分的蓝光都已经消失了。然后，他们去除了蓝光和绿光，留下了一点点的绿色，但主要是橙色和红色。当他们只去除蓝色波长时，对我们的眼睛来说，它留下了一种绿黄色的光。但是当他们去除了蓝色和大部分的绿色，留下了黄色、橙色和红色时，蜥蜴们降低了他们的体温偏好，降低了他们的热量获取速率，并且晒太阳的时间更长。光的颜色，这些波长的缺失，改变了他们的行为方式。

The authors of the study speculated that blue light is the strongest inhibitor of melatonin. So the effect could be due to the removal of the blue wavelengths, allowing the brain to synthesize melatonin. This hormone has powerful effects on daily rhythms and does include thermoregulation in reptiles. The relevance to this in real life is that when the sun is low in the sky, as it is in sunrise, sunset, and all day in the winter in higher latitudes, there's less blue in the sunlight and at night, of course, there's none. So blue is a very important wavelength for modifying circadian and seasonal rhythms because it acts as a powerful signal to the brain saying it's daytime.

研究的作者推测，蓝光是褪黑素的最强抑制剂。所以这种效应可能是由于去除了蓝色波长，使大脑能够合成褪黑素。这种激素对日常节律有强大的影响，包括爬行动物的体温调节。在现实生活中，这的相关性是，当太阳低挂在天空中，如在日出、日落和冬季的高纬度地区的整个白天，阳光中的蓝色较少，而在夜晚，当然没有。所以，蓝色是修改昼夜节律和季节节律的非常重要的波长，因为它对大脑发出强烈的信号，表明现在是白天。

We haven't even mentioned UV yet, and what's more, the sun's spectrum has very specific amounts of each wavelength, all of which are used for something by the body and all of which vary with the time of day and time of year. We only know some of those uses, we keep finding more. The questions are still just as relevant as they've always been: how much of each wavelength does each species need? Does the amount vary with the season? Does it vary with the time of day? We haven't any clear answers. We have crude estimates for the UV and crude estimates for the temperature, which is not even the same as the infrared, and we have almost nothing for visible light at all because no one's gone out there and measured it in the wild.

我们还没有提到紫外线，更重要的是，太阳的光谱对每个波长都有非常特定的量，身体会利用这些波长做某些事情，而且这些都会随着一天中的时间和一年中的时间而变化。我们只知道其中的一些用途，我们还在不断发现更多。这些问题仍然和以前一样相关：每个物种需要多少的每个波长？这个量是否会随着季节的变化而变化？它是否会随着一天中的时间而变化？我们还没有明确的答案。我们对紫外线有粗略的估计，对温度有粗略的估计，这甚至与红外线不同，而对于可见光我们几乎一无所知，因为没有人在野外测量过。

external ballasts also they're like mercury vapors they can't be dimmed they can't put on a thermostat and they have the same problem they vary a lot in their uvb output they tend to have narrow beams and the ones designed for reptiles tend to lose their uvb fairly rapidly but they do keep their visible light for years and i've used mine for their visible light long after the uvb has gone and i use other lamps for uvb next to them i'm sort of surprised at how limited the infrared is from those bulbs yeah well metal halides are designed to produce much much more in the visible light than in the infrared and in fact the the visible light is what heats is what heats the animal which is much more than the infrared gotcha they still have quite spiky uv um because the halides they use for the uvb ones are not quite as well defined as the ones they use for human lighting but i think if you're looking at the uvb range they're still spiky in uvb and i think the lamps which create the best in the uvb range are the fluorescent tubes and you can see if you look at this uvb part it matches the solar spectrum pretty well up to the boundary of uvb that really is very nice but of course the visible light is discontinuous and it's not very bright either as we know from uv tubes not being particularly bright they use a phosphor and a borosilicate glass to create that smooth increase in uvb with increasing wavelengths so if we used an incandescent lamp which is like a halogen flood or an incandescent flood which will work like that which looks like that you've got a little bit of uva and then gradually increasing with the increasing temperature you're getting increasing in red light so you can blend those two and you can supplement the missing red and infrared really well and you can add some of the other colors too so you can make a blend and you can make quite a natural looking light now you saw blue earlier on and this is his lighting array under his basking zone and i use that blend quite a lot it's um there's a t5 high output um at the top then there's a metal halide and there's an incandescent flood lamp and blue looking a bit curious and recently i was messing about with spectrometer down at ron murray's and i took the spectrum from the combo in his setup and you can have a look at that it's there and you can see it's also a t5 high output it's also a halide and a incandescent lamp and so it's filled out the spectrum you've still got the uvb down here you've still got a massive flood of visible light and you've got a build up of the infrared which as you pointed out on the on the lamp on its own is it fades off down here but here you've got quite a decent amount of infrared so that really is quite nice and of course it's got lots of uva which is which is also very nice now people always say well what about using leds instead so that's that's a spectrum of an absolutely typical white led they use a blue led a blue single colored led to drive a phosphor which emits the rest of the light and as you can see there's some big gaps there is no uva whatsoever no uvb there's a kind of a dip here with very little of the turquoise and of course it runs off into the into the red so you could work that you could put that into with with rom's combination with the t5 for the uvb and the halogen and what you get is that which you've now got a very nice uvb you've got very nice visible light lots of infrared but you've got still got this big hole here and i think that's the obvious gap but again you know it's it's it's getting there isn't it so people suggest using combinations of lamps the only trouble is you end up with this huge clutter of domes and tubes and cables all balanced together and i can quite understand people going oh i can't cope with all these lamps um and there isn't really an easy solution but my bias group worked hard on this and two years ago two members of rogue jack baldwood and adam trimmings at berkshire college of agriculture now they constructed a really neat all-in-one fixture and they look like that and it held yeah two incandescent lamps and two t5 high output tubes inside a metal frame and it's a sort of plug-and-play basking zone and this design was taken up by the uk company arcadia and i've got special permission to tell you this the units are now being made commercially and i had a flyer announcing their launch just last week and they're going to call them thermal zoo pro they're about two foot long so you could put them at one end of a large enclosure or a large tank and you can shop and change what lamps you could put in them you could put an led in one or you could put a heat projector in one so we're getting there um the technology is getting there and the understanding of the basking zone is getting there i'm sure other companies will come up with something similar to and um we're sort of improving all the time and i think that's sort of where i'm at from that point of view of getting different spectra getting going well i think that design that you just showed at the end there is nice because one of the challenges i have depending on the basking height is is getting that blend right when you have a dome sitting next to a t5 and if if you don't have enough height to have them blend down onto a basking patch it's just it's sort of like sectional so that that's another challenge as well yeah it is yeah so what about we've sort of mentioned a little bit of infrared so we've talked about the the uv and visible light and i think we'll get into a little more detail about those especially invisible light in a second but as far as rounding that spectrum out the terrestrial solar spectrum on that one graph you had halogen is that kind of what you mainly recommend as far as getting into that infrared a yeah the the infrared i think the halogen lap covers it pretty well um i can do a little bit more sharing of screen stuff we were looking at this part of the sunlight but earlier we saw that the sunlight has a second half well it's actually 48 that's infrared and that's all of this and you can see that the sunlight is mostly infrared a well the halogen lamp covers that pretty well that's the spectrum of a halogen lamp so as long as you've got something good for the visible light you're getting a lot of your infrared a from one of those it fits it quite nicely there's a little bit longer wavelength but basically it's it's covering what we want so that's quite good and another one a patio heater is almost as good for very large enclosures you know like 1.5 kilowatts they're really good of course you lose the visible light from the halogen because they're mainly just glowing in orange and red but you've still got the infrared able this is why we talk about these these patio heaters for the zoo enclosures they're very very good so those are basically your basking lamps now there's the heat projector which is getting obviously a lot of interest and it's a carbon filament lamp and what that means is that it's very very good for warming the environment because it's got a lot of infrared b and a lot of short wave a longer wavelength light but it hasn't got very much infrared a so it's very good for warming things but it's not really suitable as a basking lamp and if we look at the um the ceramic heat emitters they're far worse altogether because as you can see they've got no ira virtually no irb and and they don't even start producing irc until two thousand three thousand nanometers so they're really only environmental heaters they're heating um they're heating the air they're hitting the surroundings they're certainly not basking lamps so that's my sort of take on basking lamps um and i think that's pretty pretty much all i want to say about those yeah so a deep heat projector would be perfect if you need to maintain a nighttime temperature type thing that's not going to disrupt the day night cycle the reason they're good is that they heat directly and they heat the ground below they don't just heat the air and the surroundings so you're warming the substrate which is basically like you know the hot pavement at night which we all go looking for snakes on that kind of warmth so that's that's producing that kind of heat it's not basking heat at all it's it's environmental yeah they're very good for that very very good for that so then as far as the spectrum goes as you kind of alluded to every piece of the spectrum does something different some of some of the spectrum we probably have no idea yet we're still looking at those things so can you briefly kind of run through what we're looking at as far as what each section of the spectrum do and then maybe we'll get a little bit more into detail yeah sure if we start off with our long long wavelengths we've just gone through we've got our infrared and our red light and they actually penetrate the body of an animal quite quite well particularly the short wavelengths infrared that will penetrate right through um i think we've pretty much covered that um but also red and infrared a have biological effects it's not just warmth and i think that's something we tend to completely forget we tend to forget that isn't just heating when things are thermoregulating because red and infrared actually work on cells and they work on an enzyme called cytochrome c oxidase which is in skin cells and it actually up regulates over 100 genes and they're very important for things like controlling cell growth and wound healing they change the way the immune system works they promote the immune system for protecting against things like uva damage in fact so um it's a sort of a healing light people talk about infrared as being a healing light and it really is and it's used a lot in in medical technology using low level lasers and things like that um but i think it's one of the reasons why wild animals heal up so well in the wild and you know they're using this this natural light for heating and we move down the spectrum a bit to our visible light visible perception and we have to think about the way the reptile eyes work our eyes have got three cones and we've got three cones that respond to different colors in the back of our retina and there's a blue cone well they say blue it's responding most to blue light one that responds most to green light and one that responds to sort of orange and red and we decide what color a thing is by the way the they overlap so that if the brain sees a mixture of um this particular amount of the green stimulation with the same amount of red we go oh it's a red color and that's how we determine color vision well reptiles are slightly different and different species of reptiles are different as well so if we take say the turtle it's got the same three

English Version: External ballasts, like mercury vapors, can't be dimmed or put on a thermostat. They have the same problem of varying a lot in their UVB output. They tend to have narrow beams and the ones designed for reptiles tend to lose their UVB fairly rapidly. However, they do keep their visible light for years. I've used mine for their visible light long after the UVB has gone and I use other lamps for UVB next to them. I'm sort of surprised at how limited the infrared is from those bulbs.

Chinese Version: 外部镇流器，像汞蒸气灯，不能调暗或用恒温器控制。它们在紫外线B的输出上存在很大的变化。它们的光束倾向于狭窄，为爬行动物设计的灯泡的紫外线B很快就会减少。然而，它们的可见光可以保持多年。我在紫外线B消失后仍然使用我的灯泡进行可见光照射，并在它们旁边使用其他灯泡进行紫外线B照射。我对这些灯泡的红外线有限感到有些惊讶。

English Version: Metal halides are designed to produce much more in the visible light than in the infrared. In fact, the visible light is what heats the animal, which is much more than the infrared. They still have quite spiky UV because the halides they use for the UVB ones are not quite as well defined as the ones they use for human lighting. But I think if you're looking at the UVB range, they're still spiky in UVB.

Chinese Version: 金属卤化物灯被设计成在可见光中产生比红外线更多的光线。实际上，是可见光照射使动物感到温暖，这比红外线更多。它们的紫外线还是相当尖锐的，因为它们用于紫外线B的卤化物没有人类照明用的那么明确。但我认为，如果你在看紫外线B范围，它们在紫外线B中仍然是尖锐的。

English Version: I think the lamps which create the best in the UVB range are the fluorescent tubes. You can see if you look at this UVB part, it matches the solar spectrum pretty well up to the boundary of UVB. That really is very nice. But of course, the visible light is discontinuous and it's not very bright either, as we know from UV tubes not being particularly bright. They use a phosphor and a borosilicate glass to create that smooth increase in UVB with increasing wavelengths.

Chinese Version: 我认为在紫外线B范围内表现最好的灯是荧光管。你可以看到，如果你看这个紫外线B部分，它很好地匹配了太阳光谱，直到紫外线B的边界。这真的很好。但是，可见光是不连续的，也不是很亮，我们知道紫外线管并不特别亮。他们使用磷光粉和硼硅酸盐玻璃来创建紫外线B随波长增加的平滑增加。

English Version: If we used an incandescent lamp which is like a halogen flood or an incandescent flood which will work like that, you've got a little bit of UVA and then gradually increasing with the increasing temperature, you're getting increasing in red light. So you can supplement the missing red and infrared really well and you can add some of the other colors too. So you can make a blend and you can make quite a natural-looking light.

Chinese Version: 如果我们使用一个白炽灯，就像一个卤素泛光灯或一个白炽泛光灯，你有一点点的紫外线A，然后随着温度的增加逐渐增加，你得到的红光也在增加。因此，你可以很好地补充缺失的红光和红外线，你也可以添加一些其他的颜色。所以你可以做一个混合，你可以制造出相当自然的光线。

English Version: Now you saw Blue earlier on and this is his lighting array under his basking zone. I use that blend quite a lot. It's, um, there's a T5 high output um at the top, then there's a metal halide and there's an incandescent flood lamp.

Chinese Version: 现在你之前看到了蓝色，这是他的晒太阳区域下的照明阵列。我经常使用这种混合。顶部是一个T5高输出，然后是一个金属卤化物灯，还有一个白炽泛光灯。

English Version: And Blue's looking a bit curious. Recently, I was messing about with a spectrometer down at Ron Murray's and I took the spectrum from the combo in his setup. You can have a look at that. It's there and you can see it's also a T5 high output, it's also a halide and an incandescent lamp.

Chinese Version: 蓝色看起来有点好奇。最近，我在Ron Murray的地方用光谱仪做了些实验，我从他的设置中取得了组合的光谱。你可以看看那个。它在那里，你可以看到它也是一个T5高输出，它也是一个卤化物和一个白炽灯。

English Version: So it's filled out the spectrum. You've still got the UVB down here, you've still got a massive flood of visible light and you've got a build-up of the infrared which, as you pointed out on the lamp on its own, fades off down here. But here, you've got quite a decent amount of infrared. So that really is quite nice. And of course, it's got lots of UVA which is also very nice.

Chinese Version: 所以它填满了光谱。你在这里仍然有紫外线B，你仍然有大量的可见光，你有红外线的积累，就像你指出的灯本身，在这里逐渐消失。但在这里，你有相当多的红外线。所以那真的很好。当然，它也有很多的紫外线A，这也很好。

English Version: Now people always say, "Well what about using LEDs instead?" So that's a spectrum of an absolutely typical white LED. They use a blue LED, a blue single-colored LED, to drive a phosphor which emits the rest of the light. And as you can see, there's some big gaps. There is no UVA whatsoever, no UVB. There's a kind of a dip here with very little of the turquoise. And of course, it runs off into the red.

Chinese Version: 现在人们总是说，“那么使用LED呢？”所以这是一个绝对典型的白色LED的光谱。他们使用一个蓝色LED，一个单色的蓝色LED，来驱动一个发射剩余光的磷光粉。你可以看到，有一些大的空白。根本没有紫外线A，没有紫外线B。这里有一个凹陷，几乎没有绿松石色。当然，它在红色中消失。

English Version: So you could work that, you could put that into with Rom's combination with the T5 for the UVB and the halogen. And what you get is that which, you've now got a very nice UVB, you've got very nice visible light, lots of infrared. But you've still got this big hole here. And I think that's the obvious gap. But again, you know, it's getting there, isn't it?

Chinese Version: 所以你可以处理那个，你可以把那个和Rom的组合放在一起，用T5做紫外线B和卤素灯。你得到的是，你现在有一个非常好的紫外线B，你有非常好的可见光，很多红外线。但是你还有这个大洞。我认为那是明显的空白。但是再一次，我们正在接近那里，对吧？

English Version: So people suggest using combinations of lamps. The only trouble is you end up with this huge clutter of domes and tubes and cables all balanced together. And I can quite understand people going, "Oh, I can't cope with all these lamps." And there isn't really an easy solution.

Chinese Version: 所以人们建议使用灯的组合。唯一的问题是你最后会有一堆杂乱的灯罩、管子和电缆都平衡在一起。我完全能理解人们说，“哦，我应付不了这么多灯。”并没有真正的简单解决方案。

English Version: But my bias group worked hard on this. And two years ago, two members of Rogue, Jack Baldwood and Adam Trimmings at Berkshire College of Agriculture, they constructed a really neat all-in-one fixture. And they look like that, and it held yeah two incandescent lamps and two T5 high output tubes inside a metal frame. It's a sort of plug-and-play basking zone.

Chinese Version: 但是我的偏见小组在这方面努力工作。两年前，Rogue的两名成员，Berkshire农业学院的Jack Baldwood和Adam Trimmings，他们构建了一个非常整洁

of the green stimulation with the same amount of red we go oh it's a red color and that's how we determine color vision well reptiles are slightly different and different species of reptiles are different as well so if we take say the turtle it's got the same three cones blue green and red but it's got a fourth cone which is response responsive to uva so this turtle has a very wide range of colour vision right through from uva right through to the borderlines of infrared so it's actually got i feel like it's got wider color vision than humans have um so you know full possibilities of full color vision there you can definitely see red um but if we look at other species they can vary um geckos for example um light in twilight is mainly from after the sun has gone down completely it's mainly from diffused light in the sky so you get uh more of a blue under under the uva light because that's what's um reflected in the sky as it does it gets darker so they have very very good um vision in that range of light they can differentiate because all three of their cones will register into the blue and infrared into uva rather so you get very very good color discrimination in that type of wavelengths they can see into red but they can't necessarily discriminate much color there if we look at snakes again they vary hugely garter snakes don't have any night vision rods they only have cones so their best vision is in daylight and again they've got very good vision in uva and right through to red so they've got good color vision which is why some of them are very highly colored as well but if we look at things like the boa which is the most technical maternal activity that has a very reduced it only has two two colour cones it's also got a good number of rods for night vision which have a sensitivity somewhere in the in the blue green so that can see very well you can see very well in dusk because it's got the uva and it uses the rods for that and it can also see some of the greens and reds but probably it's colorblind in in that sense it's like red green color blind but you've got a huge range of different colors that animals can see or not see or determine what the color specifically what the color is they can see the light but they don't know what anticipate what color it is so we have to be a bit careful when we provide lighting we really need to provide a full spectrum sunlight because that's what it's evolved to use and if we change the colors and alter them then the animals are losing out um and it's just my little example there is is people sometimes say to me well can i just use red lights for heating and lighting and you think well you're wiping out all of its color vision um because everything is either red or shades of grey or black um and particularly if it's got any uva reflective parts then you're removing the ability for it to see those as well so basically you know full spectrum light is is really important um before we move away from the uva thing everyone goes on we don't know much about the uva we don't measure it um but it also does have biological effects um it it increases nitric oxide in the skin it's a defense reaction that increases vasodilation it makes the blood supply better and it also lowers the blood pressure so there are there are things that we don't know much about which could be quite important um but before we move away from visible light all together i think we should just talk a little bit about this non-visual perception because this blows my mind when i first read this section of the textbook that you had written a snippet in and i was just i couldn't believe this so please go ahead with that yeah this is this is this is what what's going on in our brains and in animal brains that that really has only been only been discovered for perhaps i don't know 15 20 years and how it works out is that we've got different photo pigments these are the photo pigments that we're very familiar with these are our cones that we see color is but also at the back of the retina in the ganglion cells we've got cells which respond differently they have a different pigment it's called melanopsin and it's a non-visual pigment it doesn't signal to the brain that they can see anything but it sends signals to parts of the brain that responsive for circadian rhythms for all that kind of of out of sight out of mind responses to light and it's mostly responsive to blue it's highly responsive to blue everyone goes why is it why is it blue and it's probably because blue light is one of the the signals of daytime when the sky changes from being dark at night to just before dawn you get the um the diffused the refracted what's the right term scattered the rally scattering of the sunlight coming up and it comes through as blue and uv and so although it's incredibly dim so you can't really recreate it in a vivarium but that incredibly dim blue light stimulates these these little cells that goes always daytime and that signals to the brain that the dawn is coming and likewise the opposite at the other end of the evening and if i just do this little diagram of this this is an iguana the light doesn't just go into its eyes because reptiles also have these photoresponsive cells with opsins like melanoxin in other parts of the brain as well and so the lights going through the lateral eyes the normal eyes it's also going through for the species that have got them through the parietal eye and the sensors in that are responsive to blue and green and also light through the skull and i don't know if any of you have ever held up a leopard gecko to a bright light you can see right through the head you know with the through the eyes but when you think about these tiny animals you hold them up to the light and you can often see the organs through them so the light's going right through the body of a small animal like that so it's not really surprising that they've made use of that by having cells inside the brain so if we just go inside his brain here they are here's his brain here's just the brain and we've got the lateral eye we've got the third eye and we've got underneath in the skull you've got the little third eye and you've got the pineal body which is the area which produces all the hormones and you've got the scn i can never say supracrystomatic nuclei which is a little group of cells which is the clocks the clock setting mechanism in the brain and you've got these tiny little photoreceptors lying in the ventricles of the brain they're all responding to light so the signals come from the light and feed into the scn and then that feeds back a loop into the pineal which is the main organ produced by producing the hormones and the neuro network neuroendocrine network so you've got an amazing system that's responding to the intensity of light the wavelengths of light and telling the brain what time of day it is and how bright it is and what season it is because how long the day length is and it's needs to be bright enough the light that we give them needs to be bright enough to stimulate the brain in this way when you think about it if you put a dim light over it there's not an awful lot going to get through the skull whereas sunlight is incredibly bright and goes right through the skull so we do have to also think about the intensity that we're producing this is queen harris's little picture which he puts up on the forums it's absolutely wonderful he went outside with his camera and took a photograph under an overcast sky and also measured the lux and he got 40 000 lux he then didn't change the camera settings he left them exactly the same and he also measured the lux in his bavarian for his beardy and it was 4 000 lux so that when he compared the photographs he went oh my gosh it's really dim in there it looks like nighttime yeah because our eyes immediately our pupils dilate and we see it as bright if we walk into a dim room and your eyes get used to it you think it's bright and certainly the beardy's eyes will do that as well but his brain won't because his brain can't open up the way our pupils do so he sees that his brain sees that as really dim and i think that's something that we haven't really got to grips with yet in in our animal husbandry we can increase the light quite a lot and then finally we go right down to the bottom and we talk about vitamin d so i don't know if we want to talk about that now or we need warmth as well yeah if we want to talk about uv yeah we can uvb right now that's probably good time to do it and of course we've got the controller synthesis which is the slightly longer wavelengths and we'll talk about that as well in a minute so i'll stop showing just for a minute um because we were going to talk a little bit i think we were going to talk a little bit about about um not like nocturnal species won't we yeah yeah maybe we'll jump to there first because i think that is one of those you know partly as you're saying you know talking about how our pupils dilate and contract makes it it makes you realize how much of our perception confuses us and it makes it so it's constantly a moving target like just our own eyes looking at our enclosures we don't even know what we're looking at half the time because your brain does so much you know mapping and so much filling in the gaps so we really can't go off of our own eyesight and i think nocturnal species are interesting because they typically you know it's getting better now but the general recommendation was they don't need light because they are nocturnal and all the way to the point where many nocturnal species are kept in in tubs that are absent of light like opaque tubs yeah so what what obviously they must still have some of those hormones being driven off of the solar the sun coming up and down so what are some of these recommendations for for nocturnal species it's it's one of those interesting things isn't it because if a land was nocturnal it's still in the wild has to know when it's day and when it's night for it to be nocturnal if you see what i mean if it was dark all the time it would never know when it was day when it was night and nocturnal activities cued by sunset and sunrise so in the case of nocturnally active creatures the fact that the light signals to the brain to block the melatonin synthesis whereas in in the active ones that blocking makes them wake up the extraordinary thing is that the biochemistry is changed with the non-internally active ones in that when you block the melatonin synthesis it sends them to sleep um and we were looking at melatonin production is the exact same for both it spikes in the evening but for nocturnal animals it

The green stimulation is perceived as red, hence, we determine color vision in this way. However, reptiles are different and there are variations among different species. For instance, turtles have the same three cones - blue, green, and red, but they also possess a fourth cone that responds to ultraviolet A (UVA). This means that turtles have a very wide range of color vision, from UVA to the borderline of infrared, which is arguably wider than the color vision of humans. This allows for the possibility of full color vision.

绿色刺激被视为红色，因此我们通过这种方式来确定色彩视觉。然而，爬行动物的情况有所不同，并且在不同的物种之间存在着差异。例如，乌龟拥有与人类相同的三种视锥细胞 - 蓝色，绿色和红色，但它们还具有对紫外线A(UVA)有反应的第四种视锥细胞。这意味着乌龟具有非常宽广的色彩视觉范围，从UVA到红外线的边界，这可能比人类的色彩视觉范围还要宽。这为全色视觉的可能性提供了条件。

For other species like geckos, their vision varies. Light in twilight, after the sun has completely set, is mainly from diffused light in the sky. This results in more blue under the UVA light, which is what is reflected in the sky as it gets darker. Geckos have excellent vision in this range of light and can differentiate colors because all three of their cones register into the blue and infrared into UVA. They can see into red, but their color discrimination in this wavelength is not as strong.

对于壁虎等其他物种，他们的视力各不相同。在日落后的黄昏中，主要的光源来自于天空中的漫射光。这导致在UVA光下有更多的蓝色，这是天空在变暗时所反射出的光。壁虎在这个光谱范围内有极好的视力，并且由于他们所有的三种视锥细胞都能接收蓝色和红外线到UVA的光，所以他们能区分颜色。他们能看到红色，但在这个波长下的色彩分辨能力不是很强。

Snakes, on the other hand, vary greatly. For instance, garter snakes do not have any night vision rods, they only have cones. Their best vision is in daylight and they have excellent vision in UVA and right through to red. This is why some of them are very highly colored. However, for other snakes like the boa, which is the most technically maternal activity, it only has two color cones. It also has a good number of rods for night vision which is sensitive to the blue-green spectrum.

另一方面，蛇类的差异非常大。例如，条纹蛇没有任何夜视杆，它们只有锥。他们的视力在白天最好，并且他们在UVA和红色光谱上有极好的视力。这就是为什么其中的一些个体颜色非常鲜艳。然而，对于其他像蟒蛇这样的蛇来说，它们只有两种颜色的视锥。它也有大量的夜视杆，对蓝绿光谱敏感。

Before we move away from the topic of UVA, it's important to note that it does have biological effects. It increases nitric oxide in the skin, causing vasodilation and lowering blood pressure. There are still many aspects of UVA that we don't know much about, which could potentially be quite significant.

在我们离开UVA的话题之前，重要的是要注意，UVA确实有生物学效应。它能增加皮肤中的一氧化氮，导致血管扩张并降低血压。关于UVA，我们还有很多方面知之甚少，这些可能都是非常重要的。

On the other hand, we also need to consider the non-visual perception. This is related to the functioning of our brains and those of animals. It was only discovered about 15-20 years ago. We have different photopigments which are familiar to us, these are our cones that we see colors with. At the back of the retina, in the ganglion cells, we have cells which respond differently. They have a different pigment called melanopsin, which is a non-visual pigment. It doesn't signal to the brain that they can see anything, but it sends signals to parts of the brain that are responsive for circadian rhythms.

另一方面，我们还需要考虑非视觉感知。这与我们的大脑和动物的大脑的功能有关。这只在大约15-20年前被发现。我们有不同的视锥细胞，这些是我们看颜色的视锥细胞。在视网膜的背部，神经节细胞中，我们有一些反应不同的细胞。它们有一种叫做黑色素蛋白的不同色素，这是一种非视觉色素。它并不向大脑发出可以看到任何东西的信号，但它向大脑的某些部位发送信号，这些部位对昼夜节律有反应。

Finally, we need to discuss vitamin D. It is important for us to provide a full spectrum of sunlight because that's what animals have evolved to use. If we alter the colors, then the animals are losing out. For instance, if we just use red lights for heating and lighting, we're wiping out all of its color vision, reducing everything to either red or shades of gray or black. If the animal has any UVA reflective parts, then we're removing the ability for it to see those as well.

最后，我们需要讨论维生素D。为动物提供全光谱的阳光是非常重要的，因为这是动物进化出来的使用方式。如果我们改变颜色，那么动物就会受到损失。例如，如果我们只使用红色灯光进行加热和照明，我们就会消除动物的所有色彩视觉，将所有东西都变成红色或灰色或黑色的阴影。如果动物有任何UVA反射部分，那么我们也会消除它看到这些部分的能力。

In conclusion, it is crucial to understand that the intensity, wavelengths, and day length of light are all important factors that affect the brains of animals. It tells the brain what time of day it is, how bright it is, and what season it is. The light that we provide for them needs to be bright enough to stimulate the brain in this way.

总的来说，了解光的强度、波长和日照长度都是影响动物大脑的重要因素是至关重要的。它告诉大脑现在是一天中的什么时候，有多亮，以及现在是什么季节。我们为它们提供的光必须足够亮，才能以这种方式刺激大脑。

extraordinary thing is that the biochemistry is changed with the non-internally active ones in that when you block the melatonin synthesis it sends them to sleep um and we were looking at melatonin production is the exact same for both it spikes in the evening but for nocturnal animals it makes them have energy and for us it makes us fall asleep yes yes that's right it is it's extraordinary it's it's like the bright light makes it makes the um blocks the meditation and when the melatonin starts to drop the nocturnal animals go to sleep because it's daytime and we looked at that a lot when i was working with primates when i was working with the zoos because that's they've done quite a lot of work on that but i mean going back to the thing about it being dark all the time there isn't anywhere on the surface of the earth apart from really deep caves where daylight doesn't penetrate because even in a a cave or a tunnel you know you can see the light from the outside you can see the entrance of the tunnel you can see whether the sun's there or it isn't there and the sun always comes and goes in predictable patterns there's only one place which is really common for it not to do that and that's in a windowless room or in an opaque rub on a shelf as you as you pointed out and when nocturnal species are studied in the wild we we find that most of them aren't strictly nocturnal many of them are ephemeral they're active at any time of the day francis coskeri has a huge collection of photos of nocturnal geckos from all over the world that he's photographed out in daylight and even in full sunlight and i've got a few of his pictures too and some of my own um but the main activity period is often at dusk or in the early part of the night because that's when the environment is still warm enough for them to be optimally active so their rhythms synchronize with both light and temperature changing over the course of the day so the study we talked about where the tokay gecko altered its body temperature because it could sense the bright light was no longer warming the area below it now that's really interesting um that nocturnal animal is modulating according to the light it sees during the day so yeah i i can't see any reason why you would keep an animal without without at least some exposure to the daylight well i sort of think yeah it's you know we are a diurnal species so that it would be making the same claim would be saying well we never need darkness because we are active during the light so we'll just leave the lights on and imagine how crazy you'd go after three days of that yeah that's right and actually it would be very damaging yes it would um but it's amazing how resilient reptiles are i mean they can live in in the pitch dark because people have done so but their body rhythms have got to be skewed they're skewed by doing that so then you know theoretically just say you have an animal that spends most of its time in a hide and it would see the mouth of the hide as the light and that's going to give its cue you could see a keeper saying well why don't i just provide like a simple light bulb that's going to signify the day night and why do i need to go to the lengths of going uv full spectrum and infrared if it's only going to be using it as a visual cue if that makes sense well it isn't really is it um the the um the uv is in the light it's it's it's very diluted of course if the light's very dim but the proportion of it will be exactly the same because it's not filtered out by the cave the light that's coming into the cave has the same spectrum as full sunlight it's just a lot a lot less of it so you're still going to get a lot of uvb and a lot of animals sleep in crevices in bark and in corners under foliage they're in daylight all day and and quite a few some of the geckos for example they sleep on the trunk of the tree which which gets full light for daylight it may not get actual sunlight because it would be too hot but um like i think they're getting uv they're getting quite high levels of uv sometimes during the day and so what about this we were talking earlier about the thermal conformers where they are not necessarily using the bright light as a signal for where to bask as far as your concern is for setting up lighting would be the exact same and you'll let them maybe you have more cage decor to dim out the light or what do you what are your thoughts there yeah just i think i think that's a good one actually um off the top of my head i think i just i just try and replicate dappled sunlight because underneath trees you always get that mosaic of of bright and dark um it's sometimes very very small circles of dark and light all into intertwining and i would imagine the thermoconformer can see that as well as anyone else and then we'll move into an area which is the right temperature and move around most of the thermal conformers aren't stripped ammo conformers actually they they tend to shift they go up and down trees and and move around the bark um to to maintain the temperature they want um so they are actually so regulating but not in the in the full basking sense right well and i think a story that i've told in the podcast before is when i created that sort of dappling effect with my jungle carpet python that was the first time i'd seen his natural coloration and his his pattern come into play as far as camouflage goes because it was this sort of dappling of the sun slants of sun coming through the enclosure and then all of a sudden his you know contrast of dark black bars and yellow bars it made perfect sense he became very difficult to see in the back of the enclosure where before it was like very obvious like there's a yellow and black snake he can't hide anywhere but so the animals are off evolving in those environments and they're using that the speckled sun to to be part of their camouflage as well yeah makes perfect sense doesn't it they've evolved to use the environment that they normally live in yeah so maybe we can shift gears to a little bit more about the dusk and dawn because that was another area you mentioned early on in the podcast is one of the difficult things with replicating sunlight too is the fact that it waxes and wanes throughout the day and we're starting to see people play with that sam sam parrot is a perfect example he's gone totally mad doing this insane project and it's one of my favorite reptile projects happening right now and so how important is that dusk and dawn do you think for the physiology of reptiles i think it's becoming a very exciting development i don't think it's going to be something that most people can afford to do or have the knowledge to do but i'm not sure that that's necessarily a problem because i think i think it's very important not to have all your lights come on at once and all go off at once because you know the animal just freezes wherever it's sitting if the light suddenly goes off um i think that could be quite stressful and quite alarming but it's going to be it's really hard to create that very very slow lightning lightning of the sky before sunrise and even the slow onset of of sunrise when you get that orange color and then very quickly within four or five minutes even it's changing automatically right to get all the other wavelengths in um so i think you could probably just do a very simple thing um i've never tried to recreate that wonderful slow rise it's quite difficult to actually get um lamps which will which will do that and automatic systems that will do that but if you've got windows in your house and you haven't got a very unusual very very long twilights and things like that depending on how far north you live i suppose your animals do perceive a sort of pale version of natural dawner dusk through the windows so that that helps particularly in the summer but um you can you can recreate a very simple dusk and dawn if you just got simple plug-in timers and you put your incandescent lamps on first so that the light starts with a low level orange red flow and then a short while later on come your uv lamps and then maybe finally for full daylight your metal halides or your leds so you've got a succession of two or three steps which aren't quite as bad as the whole lot coming on at once and then obviously at sunset you can go off in reverse reverse order and you don't need any extra sort of complicated knowledge of electronics or anything like before that um but there are increasingly sophisticated ways and yes sam perry's project is really quite exciting isn't it um and i think that yeah yeah but i think people will start doing that um but they do need to be like sam they do need to look very carefully at what the wild animal gets because you could so easily get it completely wrong couldn't you you could make the sunrise all the wrong times and everything which might even be worse but um leds i think are the way forward for that because you can program them so easily into arrays coming on with different color balances um but you can dim incandescent lamps they're very easy to dim and you can even get dimming ballasts for t5 high output tubes and then if you've got the big systems with the patio heaters you can use controllers to alter the power supply there's a uk company called sunswitch that's invented a programmable uvb and infrared system called an equid and it was designed initially for horse solaria that's why it's called an equity and it creates huge basking zones for zoo animals and horses and you can program it with a ramp up in the morning and ramp down in the evening on a pc um and i tested a prototype in my conservatory i've actually got it here for blue when he's free roaming and i can actually show you that oh sure yeah um here it is look um there's the the tubes the t5 tubes and there's the um the infrared and there's blue down the bottom sitting on the edge um he eats the tomatoes he looks like he could do some damage in there oh yeah he does he's quite fun but um but yeah so that's that's basically um yeah i think that's probably have we covered more or less that i think we can't go much further with that yeah i think that's a good tip sonics yeah it's a bit above my level of understanding oh yeah if anyone wants they can go back to the episode i did with sam you'll see how complicated it is and he's constantly kind of doing all these algorithms it's pretty neat but what i do too is i just have my halogens click on and in the morning that's and i do have one like phillips phillips makes a bulb that you can attach to your wi-fi and it allows you to it's just a simple led

The extraordinary thing is that the biochemistry changes with the non-internally active ones. When you block the melatonin synthesis, it sends them to sleep. We were looking at melatonin production: it's the exact same for both; it spikes in the evening. For nocturnal animals, it gives them energy, and for us, it makes us fall asleep. Yes, that's right. It's extraordinary. It's like the bright light blocks the meditation, and when the melatonin starts to drop, the nocturnal animals go to sleep because it's daytime. We looked at that a lot when I was working with primates when I was working with the zoos because they've done quite a lot of work on that.

非常奇妙的是，非内源活动物种的生物化学会发生变化。当你阻断褪黑素合成时，它会使它们入睡。我们研究了褪黑素的产生：对于两者来说，它在晚上达到高峰。对于夜行动物来说，它给予它们能量，对于我们人类来说，它使我们入睡。是的，没错。这非常奇妙。就像强烈的光线阻挡了冥想，当褪黑素开始下降时，夜行动物因为是白天而入睡。在我和灵长类动物一起工作，以及在动物园工作的时候，我们对此进行了大量的研究。

But I mean, going back to the thing about it being dark all the time, there isn't anywhere on the surface of the earth, apart from really deep caves, where daylight doesn't penetrate. Because even in a cave or a tunnel, you know, you can see the light from the outside. You can see the entrance of the tunnel, you can see whether the sun's there or it isn't there. The sun always comes and goes in predictable patterns. There's only one place which is really common for it not to do that, and that's in a windowless room or in an opaque rub on a shelf, as you pointed out.

但是，我想说的是，关于它总是黑暗的事情，地球表面上除了非常深的洞穴外，没有任何地方是阳光无法穿透的。因为即使在洞穴或隧道里，你也能看到外面的光。你可以看到隧道的入口，可以看到太阳是否在那里。太阳总是按照可预测的模式升起和落下。只有一个地方很常见，那就是你指出的没有窗户的房间或者架子上的不透明橡皮。

And when nocturnal species are studied in the wild, we find that most of them aren't strictly nocturnal. Many of them are ephemeral. They're active at any time of the day. Francis Coskeri has a huge collection of photos of nocturnal geckos from all over the world that he's photographed out in daylight, and even in full sunlight. And I've got a few of his pictures too, and some of my own. But the main activity period is often at dusk or in the early part of the night because that's when the environment is still warm enough for them to be optimally active. So, their rhythms synchronize with both light and temperature changing over the course of the day.

当我们在野外研究夜行物种时，我们发现大多数夜行物种并不是严格的夜行性。它们中的许多是短暂的，它们在一天中的任何时候都活跃。弗朗西斯·科斯克里有一大堆他在白天，甚至在阳光充足的时候拍摄的来自世界各地的夜行壁虎的照片。我也有他的一些照片，还有一些是我自己的。但是，主要的活动期通常在黄昏或夜晚的早些时候，因为那时候的环境仍然足够温暖，它们可以在最佳状态下活动。所以，它们的生物节律会随着一天中的光照和温度变化而同步。

So the study we talked about, where the Tokay gecko altered its body temperature because it could sense the bright light was no longer warming the area below it, now that's really interesting. That nocturnal animal is modulating according to the light it sees during the day. So yeah, I can't see any reason why you would keep an animal without at least some exposure to the daylight.

因此，我们谈到的那项研究，其中Tokay壁虎由于能感觉到明亮的光线不再使其下方的区域变暖而改变了体温，这是非常有趣的。那种夜行动物根据它在白天看到的光线进行调节。所以，我看不出有什么理由会让动物没有至少一些暴露在阳光下的时间。

Well, I sort of think, yeah, it's, you know, we are a diurnal species, so that it would be making the same claim would be saying, "Well, we never need darkness because we are active during the light. So we'll just leave the lights on." And imagine how crazy you'd go after three days of that. Yeah, that's right. And actually, it would be very damaging. Yes, it would. But it's amazing how resilient reptiles are. I mean, they can live in the pitch dark because people have done so, but their body rhythms have got to be skewed. They're skewed by doing that.

我倒是觉得，我们是白天活动的物种，所以同样的说法就是，“我们从来不需要黑暗，因为我们在光线下活动。所以我们就让灯一直开着。”试想一下，如果这样三天，你会多么疯狂。是的，没错。实际上，这会非常有害。是的，它会。但是，爬行动物的恢复力令人惊奇。我的意思是，它们可以在漆黑的环境中生活，因为人们已经这样做过，但它们的生物节律肯定会被扭曲。这样做就会扭曲它们的生物节律。

So then, theoretically, just say you have an animal that spends most of its time in a hide and it would see the mouth of the hide as the light, and that's going to give its cue. You could see a keeper saying, "Well, why don't I just provide a simple light bulb that's going to signify the day/night, and why do I need to go to the lengths of going UV, full spectrum, and infrared if it's only going to be using it as a visual cue, if that makes sense?"

那么，理论上，假设你有一种动物大部分时间都在藏匿之中，并且它会将藏匿处的入口视为光线，这将给出它的提示。你可能会看到饲养员说：“那我为什么不只提供一个简单的灯泡来表示白天/黑夜呢，如果它只是用它作为视觉提示，我为什么还需要提供紫外线、全光谱和红外线呢，如果这有道理的话？”

algorithms it's pretty neat but what i do too is i just have my halogens click on and in the morning that's and i do have one like phillips phillips makes a bulb that you can attach to your wi-fi and it allows you to it's just a simple led and it will slowly ramp on from nothing to sort of a warmer light so i do that on one of my closures just to sort of simulate a sunrise but i think the best thing is filter yeah exactly filter sunlight through the window turn the halogens on first and and avoid that complete pitch blackness to full-on daylight over a second is probably best so maybe we can wrap up finishing we're going to talk about uvb so maybe we can go back to that and wrap up with that yeah i think we we often relate uvb to to dc3 synthesis and that's kind of where we put all of our eggs in the basket there but it also does many other things as well so maybe we could just kind of round out the conversation discussing that yeah sure this is just a little bit from one of the talks i've given and i think it's probably i've managed to animate it sufficiently to to run through it um so you basically got this turtle is you know that's our reptile you've got the uvb in the light and um first of all i think people don't often realize that uvb itself has direct local effects which are quite important on skin and it kills bacteria functioning viruses and there was a long debate about does does uvb kill viruses yes it does it kills viruses and bacterial fungi on the skin so that's a direct effect which is quite beneficial it also um affects the skin cells nothing to do with vitamin d it's just the way that the uvb works it actually modulates the immune system it stimulates the white blood cells and lymphocytes and we all know it causes tanning which is melanocytes producing pigment melanin so it's important for skin health i'm talking about sensible amounts of uvb obviously natural amounts of uvb not not just blasting things it also creates beta endorphins in skins the skin cells respond by secreting beta endorphin when of course that's our happiness hormone so that gets into the bloodstream and it's it's a huge stimulus for animals to bask because it makes it feel nice and i think it does for us too and of course vitamin d so we look at the vitamin d uvb works on cholesterol and skin it's a very simple biochemical change it turns that 7dc cholesterol into a chemical called pre-d3 when the animal is warm that 3d3 transforms itself automatically into vitamin d3 there's a slightly more complicated process than that but that's a pretty good summary of how it works so you've got vitamin d3 in the skin now in the skin it has a local effect on skin cells within the skin cells there are enzymes which will transform the vitamin d3 into 25 hydroxy vitamin d they hydroxylate the vitamin d and they also have a second enzyme which turns it into 125 hydroxy and that is an active hormone that's a very potent hormone and what it does is inside those cells it works on the dna to transcribe genes and also to signal between the cells so the skin is actually working with the vitamin d3 and it improves the health of the skin because it stimulates antimicrobial peptides so that's a little little chemicals which prevent bacteria from and viruses from from getting into the cells also increases the cell wall barrier so that it's a stronger barrier against invasion from pathogens and also it modulates skin cell division so the skin cells are tend not to be stimulated to to divide too much and it modulates the immune system by working on the white blood cells in the skin so you've got more skin health because of the vitamin d but the vitamin d doesn't just stay in the skin it moves into the bloodstream and that's called systemic effects that the effects to the rest of the body so the first thing that vitamin d3 does is it goes in the bloodstream to the liver and that enzyme which we talked about before converts it to the 25 hydroxy d and releases it into the bloodstream as that it doesn't go any further in the liver you can also have vitamin d3 in the diet doing the same thing of course you haven't got the skin effects but you've got it going straight through to the liver from the gut and a small amount of it is needed every day to be passed into the bloodstream to go to the kidney where it activates it it produces that second transformation into the 125 hydroxy t3 which is the active hormone and that's an endocrine function which means it's it's carried in the bloodstream and it's under very tight control with the levels of parathyroid hormone and the calcium and phosphate in your blood and what it does is it works on your calcium metabolism and everybody knows vitamin d and calcium go together it's been known for many many years and what it does is it enables you to take up calcium from the gut and it enables it to be laid down in the bone and it also keeps the levels up for your muscles your growth your reproduction all of those need calcium that's the classic picture and that was all it was known until perhaps 20 or 30 years ago but what would happen if you had more vitamin d3 if you had the optimal amounts that the animal needs when it's naturally in a good environment well you then have plenty because you don't need much for this process so you start to get enough to overflow and fill up the rest all the rest of the body and it goes to all the different organs in the body and every virtually every organ they look at has the way of of picking up the 25 hydroxy t3 into their cells and it's called an autocrine and parican function which just means basically it's not an endocrine hormone and also the d3 itself before it's transformed that will also flood the system it has a very short short life only only 24 hours so you need d3 every day to get that effect for going into your into all the different organs and that is also transformed inside these cells just as it was in skin to the 25 hydroxy t and to the 125 so inside the cells you've got this tiny little system going on in each cell of making active hormone that doesn't escape into the bloodstream because if it did it would muck up the calcium metabolism but inside the cells it does the same things as it did in the skin cells the gene transcription the intracellular signaling and it controls over 2 000 genes it's a really important hormone and when you look at all the different things that it does depending on which organ it's in it's just amazing it alters the immune responses it activates the immune system to withstand things like a cytokine storm identifying um which proteins are invading and making sure that you get an antibody response not a cytokine storm it regulates cell division it's really important in identifying when cells go wrong so it picks up possible cancer cells and enables them to be thrown out by the body so it's it's also preventing problems it's involved in neural development in in growing embryos it's often thought that when they die in shell and they never hatch it's possibly to do with the lack of vitamin d or the lack of calcium which is because of the lack of vitamin d um not enabling the muscle development to do that final twist that they need to get the head in the right position to get out of the shell and also they've found that when you have injuries vitamin d will help repair of nerves um in humans it's been worked out that it affects insulin production it affects cardiac function it's really complicated systems and it affects fertility um there's been quite a lot of trials of vitamin d actually affecting sperm count um and obviously affecting egg production because you've got to have the calcium as well for the egg shells and to be laid down and you've also got to have the d3 for the embryo to be able to utilize the calcium so there's an awful lot going on um and we miss out a lot if we're insufficient because if you're insufficient you lose all of that lot straight away you you get you this is absolutely vital for life because you need it for your muscles your growth you've got to have this so the body prioritizes this and case forgets about that and an awful lot of people are walking around today with this sort of level of vitamin d enough to keep us going but you don't get any of that bonus extra you don't get that you would normally get if it was coursing through your blood that's right that's right but if you get deficient if you get really deficient then you haven't even got enough for the kidney to make the calcium metabolism work you've already lost all your systemic effects and now you're going to start having problems with this what happens then if you haven't got enough of this is that you can't absorb your calcium from your gut and you've got a problem because it can't be laid down into the bone or and this starts to go wrong and this is where you're starting to get your metabolic bone disease because you're starting to get you're twitching low calcium and then if it carries on what happens then is your blood calcium levels start to fall and that gives your body a jerk the parathyroid gland cuts in and says hang on guys what's going wrong here it pushes the kidney to produce every bit of parathyroid or every bit of uh 125 it can and what that does it also works on the bone directly is to push the calcium to come out of the bones because it wasn't coming out of the gut it's going to come from somewhere and the parasite hormone pushes the calcium to come out of the bones to keep you alive and that is where you get in your mbd i think that's pretty much explained whatever mbd is you've got these all the bones get really frail because all the calcium has been leached out of them if you get them healing you get these classic sorts of half-heeled bones this is a little frog believe it or not with mbd and it's just a sad case because it's also totally preventable because you have to be so deficient in vitamin d to have that happen so i think we would stop there it's really amazing and it sort of it sort of makes you as you learn all these different functions of light in general not just uv it's hard to not think about yourself as a human thinking i am barely in the sun especially living where i live i don't spend enough time in the sun and i imagine how much health disorders are associated with just that alone with not getting any of those extra benefits from d3 being low on d3 and it's it's pretty remarkable yes it is and the nice thing about humans is that we're quite good at absorbing it from the gut right so so supplementing vitamin d especially when you've got things like coping around it's really good to do that to get your immune system up to scratch and there's there's loads of loads of research being done on that but yeah you can take vitamin d supplements yeah

Algorithms are pretty neat. However, what I do too is to have my halogens click on in the morning. Phillips makes a bulb that you can attach to your Wi-Fi. It's just a simple LED and it will slowly ramp on from nothing to a warmer light. I do that on one of my enclosures just to simulate a sunrise. The best thing is to filter sunlight through the window, turn the halogens on first, and avoid that complete pitch blackness to full-on daylight over a second. Now, let's wrap up and talk about UVB. We often relate UVB to DC3 synthesis, but it also does many other things.

算法是非常巧妙的。然而，我也会让我的卤素灯在早晨自动打开。飞利浦制造了一种灯泡，您可以将其连接到您的Wi-Fi。这只是一种简单的LED，它会从无到有慢慢变亮，最后呈现出更暖和的光。我在我的一个设备上使用这种方法来模拟日出。最好的方法是通过窗户过滤阳光，先打开卤素灯，避免在一秒钟内从完全的黑暗转变为全亮。现在，让我们总结一下，并谈谈UVB。我们经常将UVB与DC3合成联系起来，但它还有许多其他的作用。

This is just a little bit from one of the talks I've given. You've basically got this turtle, our reptile, and the UVB in the light. UVB itself has direct local effects which are quite important on skin. It kills bacteria, functioning viruses, and there was a long debate about whether UVB kills viruses, yes it does. It kills viruses and bacterial fungi on the skin. UVB also affects the skin cells, stimulates the white blood cells and lymphocytes, and causes tanning. It's important for skin health, and I'm talking about sensible amounts of UVB, not just blasting things. It also creates beta endorphins in skins. The skin cells respond by secreting beta endorphin, our happiness hormone. So, it's a huge stimulus for animals to bask because it makes it feel nice and I think it does for us too.

这只是我之前的讲话中的一部分。你基本上了解了这只乌龟，我们的爬行动物，以及光中的UVB。UVB本身对皮肤有直接的局部效应，这是非常重要的。它可以杀死细菌，功能性病毒，关于是否UVB能杀死病毒的争论已经持续了很长时间，答案是肯定的。它可以杀死皮肤上的病毒和细菌真菌。UVB还影响皮肤细胞，刺激白细胞和淋巴细胞，并导致晒黑。这对皮肤健康很重要，我所说的是合理的UVB量，而不是过量的。它还在皮肤中产生β-内啡肽。皮肤细胞通过分泌β-内啡肽来应对，这是我们的快乐荷尔蒙。因此，这对动物来说是一个巨大的刺激，因为它使它们感觉良好，我认为对我们也是如此。

And of course, there's Vitamin D. UVB works on cholesterol in the skin. It's a very simple biochemical change, it turns that 7DC cholesterol into a chemical called pre-D3. When the animal is warm, that 3D3 transforms itself automatically into Vitamin D3. There's a slightly more complicated process than that, but that's a pretty good summary of how it works. You've got Vitamin D3 in the skin now. In the skin, it has a local effect on skin cells. Within the skin cells, there are enzymes which transform the Vitamin D3 into 25 hydroxy Vitamin D. They hydroxylate the Vitamin D and also have a second enzyme which turns it into 125 hydroxy. That is an active hormone, a very potent hormone. What it does is inside those cells, it works on the DNA to transcribe genes and also to signal between the cells. The skin is actually working with the Vitamin D3 and it improves the health of the skin because it stimulates antimicrobial peptides.

当然，还有维生素D。UVB作用于皮肤中的胆固醇。这是一个非常简单的生化变化，它将7DC胆固醇转化为一种叫做前D3的化学物质。当动物体温升高时，这种3D3会自动转化为维生素D3。这个过程比这稍微复杂一些，但这已经是一个很好的工作原理的概述了。现在你在皮肤中有了维生素D3。在皮肤中，它对皮肤细胞有局部效应。在皮肤细胞中，有一种酶可以将维生素D3转化为25羟基维生素D。他们使维生素D羟基化，并有第二种酶将其转化为125羟基。这是一种活性激素，一种非常强效的激素。它在这些细胞内部作用于DNA，以转录基因并在细胞之间进行信号传递。皮肤实际上是在与维生素D3一起工作，它改善了皮肤的健康，因为它刺激了抗微生物肽的产生。

But the Vitamin D doesn't just stay in the skin, it moves into the bloodstream and that's called systemic effects, the effects to the rest of the body. The first thing that Vitamin D3 does is it goes in the bloodstream to the liver and that enzyme which we talked about before converts it to the 25 hydroxy D and releases it into the bloodstream. You can also have Vitamin D3 in the diet doing the same thing. Of course, you haven't got the skin effects but you've got it going straight through to the liver from the gut. A small amount of it is needed every day to be passed into the bloodstream to go to the kidney where it activates it. It produces that second transformation into the 125 hydroxy T3 which is the active hormone. That's an endocrine function which means it's carried in the bloodstream and it's under very tight control with the levels of parathyroid hormone and the calcium and phosphate in your blood.

但是维生素D并不仅仅停留在皮肤中，它会进入血液，这就是所谓的全身效应，即对身体其他部分的影响。维生素D3做的第一件事是进入血液到达肝脏，我们之前谈到的那种酶将其转化为25羟基D并释放到血液中。你也可以通过饮食摄取维生素D3来做同样的事情。当然，你没有皮肤效应，但你可以直接从肠道到肝脏。每天需要一小部分进入血液，然后到达肾脏，在那里它被激活。它产生了第二次转化，变成了125羟基T3，这是活性激素。这是一个内分泌功能，意味着它被血液携带，并且在甲状旁腺激素和血液中的钙和磷的水平下受到非常严格的控制。

What it does is it works on your calcium metabolism. Everybody knows Vitamin D and calcium go together. It's been known for many years. What it does is it enables you to take up calcium from the gut and it enables it to be laid down in the bone. It also keeps the levels up for your muscles, your growth, your reproduction, all of those need calcium. That was all it was known until perhaps 20 or 30 years ago. But what would happen if you had more Vitamin D3? If you had the optimal amounts that the animal needs when it's naturally in a good environment, you then have plenty because you don't need much for this process. So you start to get enough to overflow and fill up the rest, all the rest of the body. It goes to all the different organs in the body and virtually every organ they look at has a way of picking up the 25 hydroxy T3 into their cells.

它的作用是影响你的钙代谢。每个人都知道维生素D和钙是相辅相成的。这已经被人们所知道多年了。它的作用是使你能够从肠道吸收钙，并使其能够在骨头中沉积。它还保持你的肌肉、生长、繁殖所需的钙的水平。这就是所有人在20或30年前知道的所有信息。但是，如果你有更多的维生素D3会发生什么呢？如果你在自然环境良好的情况下有动物需要的最佳数量，那么你就会有很多，因为你对这个过程的需求并不大。所以你开始有足够的量溢出，并填满身体的其他所有部分。它进入身体的所有不同的器官，几乎每个器官都有一种方式将25羟基T3带入他们的细胞

gut right so so supplementing vitamin d especially when you've got things like coping around it's really good to do that to get your immune system up to scratch and there's there's loads of loads of research being done on that but yeah you can take vitamin d supplements yeah but well uvb you're missing all the effects the uvb does so you know people say well can't i just give my reptiles powdered vitamin d and i said well yes you can yes you can definitely can but you're going to miss out all those effects that we've talked about of the skin and the antibacterial effects and just the general well-being of you know from from being out in the sun yeah yeah even that beta endorphin like you talked about that feel good feeling you'd be depriving that of the animal without offering it yeah and i think one of the things that happens is now that we're having this very big swing over to uv use which is great i think sometimes people forget that uv needs to be provided properly and you can provide too much or you can set your enclosure up in a way where uv now becomes a danger it's not just as simple as placing a bulb and putting a basking spot under it because you if you can get burns and whatnot so what are some of the dangers of using it incorrectly and how can people make sure they use it safely that's a good point yeah i think we do there was a stage where everybody wanted more and more uv and it really caused problems um reptiles and people and all living things they've evolved to cope with what they encounter every day in their environment where they evolved and not just cope with it but also thrive with it so if we do provide you you've got to do it at safe levels and that doesn't just mean a natural sunlight spectrum it also means not exceeding the sort of levels that the species would see in the wild and i think the ferguson zones can help there in an understanding that we don't want to blast them with iuv but i think one thing that we have to bear in mind is that we don't normally vary the uv level during the day labs come on in the morning they go off in the evening and i think fair enough but what it we generally say is is to have a rule is to offer like morning levels of uv because that's when most species bask rather than the maximum they might get at noon when actually they're more likely to be sheltering and always to pair that uv with the basking lamp so that it's a patch of sunlight and this is why if you can afford one you know a centimeter six five uv index meter is really superb for setting up the lamps monitoring the lifespan of the lamp um and so when what can go wrong all the major companies like zoomed zilla arcadia they're well aware of the risks of getting the spectrum role um especially with the non-terrestrial very short wavelengths uvb and uvc and i don't think they're i think they're very unlikely to come out with anything hazardous if you follow the recommendations there are still a few lamps out there which are not safe mostly they're cheap chinese imports they're sold under a brand name that you might not have heard of some of the cheap fluorescent tubes and compacts can have flaws in the phospho coatings that let traces of uvc through small halogen bulbs with no front glass now they're being sold as all-in-one heat light and uv bulbs on amazon ebay and they're often being sold direct from china and they emit a very unnatural spectrum with short wavelength uvb and even uvc in very narrow beams they can also reach really dangerously high temperatures as well i nearly set fire to my test kit because i put them under little blocks i have a black a white and a brown block for the temperatures at about a foot distance and the black block went up to in the 90s centigrade so it was nearly it's it's actually smoldering it was terrifying i couldn't believe it but anyway that was a 50 watt one it was quite a narrow beam as you can imagine but you just have to be really careful because they're selling these as uvb all in one lamps and they're getting you know it usually says three naught on it while they've chosen three naught i have no idea um so if you avoid those all those sort of things um and also there's some chinese brand uvb leds that have appeared recently um again they're usually sent from china you you actually order them from the chinese company and one or two of them have got dangerous spectra with non-terrestrial uvb and serena wunderlich in germany's tested a couple and found them to be quite unpleasant but if you avoid those and you use the tried and tested products i suppose the real risk is just over exposure of your eyes and your skin and i suppose that's just common sense really you need to find out what the minimum safe distances are and just don't let the animal get any closer and it always provides shade and shelter from the uv and restrict your sun strength uvb your morning sun uvb just restrict it to the basking zone so that you've got a gradient into shade um and the other thing is don't use those nuts with narrow beams if you can see that it's only lighting up a small circle that's smaller than your reptile's body the uvb can be quite concentrated there i mean metal mercury vapor lamps are really prone to that you get these little circles some of them have awfully narrow beams and the whole animal isn't getting it it's just like half of its back so obviously the heating and the lighting is not going to be normal um but you probably won't see much in the way of damage the first sign of overexposures often that photocharacter conjunctivitis there's no blindness in humans where the little cornea is so delicate it's first affected by the uv and it feels like you've got glass in your eye which fortunately i've never had but um and the reptiles they huddle with their eyes closed it's just awful imagining the pain that it is and sometimes if it's severe that little eyelids swell up too and back in you know back in 2005 6 was quite a few and and but if you remove the lamp the healing is really quick because the cornea regenerates really fast it can only take two or three days even three or four days and the eyes open again and they're fine you can get skin sunburns um they're just blisters like it does with us like thermal burns um if it's chronic it can cause like an abnormal shedding with damaged skin usually on the back or the shoulders and if it's very chronic exposure you can get prolonged skin damage and although reptiles are very resistant to skin cancer compared to mammals you can get um you can end up with with some of the skin cancer but it's very unusual um uh the other thing is people often ask whether too much uv can cause too much vitamin d enough to cause toxicity and it's quite widely known now that if it doesn't happen in natural sunlight because there's a natural buffering system in the presence of strong sunlight other photo products form as well as the pre d3 and also once it's formed into d3 the xsd3 is actually broken down by sunlight if it's not been taken into the body but it does require a spectrum similar to sunlight a continuous spectrum in the uvb and up into the uva and some of the new lamps including some of the prototype uvb leds actually they don't have that type of spectrum they have little spikes where they think there's going to be really good d3 forming they're more like d3 drug producing lamps and theoretically it's only theoretical the buffering system could be compromised and you could get excess d3 but the thing is we've no idea if that's actually going to occur or if it will occur how long it would take whether to be a build up or whether the body would just excrete it you know like it normally does it breaks down excess passes it out in in the urine and in the faeces but we don't know we just don't know and and i think i'd like to see a lot more research on long-term exposure um no one's done the blood testing which is what what you need and blood testing is expensive it's going to be quite difficult to get it done yeah yeah and i mean that's the nature of new technology developing we there's going to be always holes in the knowledge until we kind of understand how certain things work and so i think at the end of the day if you follow the you know stick with the normal brands the usual reptile brands follow the packaging if you don't have a solar meter make sure the distance is whatever the package says and provide shade you can be pretty sure that you're providing safe amounts of uv yes excellent well dr baines this was a very full conversation and this is definitely one that people are going to want to go back and listen to more than once because it's one of those ones where you just listen to things a couple of times to fully grasp it is there anything that we didn't say that you wanted to to mention before that we kind of hit everything we wanted to talk today i think we'll definitely have you back i think you'll probably have to edit half of it out oh no no no this is all good stuff too much yeah no it's been really good really really good fun yeah as far as for anyone that's looking to get in touch with you i know you're active on some facebook group groups uh are you comfortable on reptile lighting i think you're most i'm always nervous to give someone their email because we don't want to you know who knows what you're going to get bombarded by but can you let anybody know if they wanted to touch base with you where they could do that yeah i think through the reptile lighting facebook forum um i'm trying to retire i've been i mean gradually you know saying goodbye to the different forums because i've reached retirement age i get my pension next month um so i'm slowly i'm slowly withdrawing a little bit um i've got i've got some things i want to do i want to write a book um but i'm i'm still around and i think through the reptile lighting forum because then if you don't get me and if i'm too busy and i can't answer i tend to struggle with um private messaging i'll be absolutely honest i get so many inquiries and i hate i hate turning them down but sometimes i just think well it's better if they go on the forum and post because we've got a really good admin team we've got some smashing people and they're really knowledgeable and they'll answer the inquiries long before and in fact quite often i'll start answering one and then i see it's already being answered and somebody's you know it says so-and-so is typing and i think all right let it go which is really good it's really nice well and it's better to have it there in a public form because then if someone has a question you can search the form and then the question may already be there so if you do have a question just

First, let's talk about the importance of vitamin D supplementation, especially in times like these when we are dealing with health issues like Covid-19. It's crucial to keep our immune system strong, and there's plenty of research to back this up. Yes, you can take vitamin D supplements, but remember, when you're missing out on UVB exposure, you're also missing out on its numerous effects. People often ask, "Can't I just give my reptiles powdered vitamin D?" Yes, you can. However, you'll be missing out on the benefits we've discussed regarding skin health, antibacterial effects, and overall well-being that comes from sun exposure. Even the production of beta-endorphin, the "feel-good" hormone, could be compromised without offering UVB exposure.

首先，我们来谈谈维生素D补充的重要性，特别是在我们现在应对如Covid-19等健康问题的时期。保持我们的免疫系统强壮至关重要，有大量的研究来支持这一点。是的，你可以服用维生素D补充剂，但请记住，当你缺乏UVB曝晒时，你也会错过它的众多效果。人们经常问，“我不能只给我的爬行动物提供维生素D粉末吗？”是的，你可以。然而，你将错过我们已经讨论过的关于皮肤健康、抗菌效果和来自阳光曝晒的整体健康的好处。即使是产生“感觉良好”荷尔蒙的β-内啡肽的生产，也可能在没有提供UVB曝晒的情况下受到影响。

Now, while we're seeing a significant shift towards the use of UV, it's important to remember that it needs to be provided correctly. It's not as simple as just placing a bulb and setting a basking spot under it. UV can pose a danger if used incorrectly and can cause burns. So what are some of the dangers of using it incorrectly and how can people ensure they use it safely? Well, there was a time when everyone wanted more and more UV, which led to problems. All living beings, including reptiles and humans, have evolved to cope with their daily environmental conditions. When providing UV, it's important to do so at safe levels, which not only means a natural sunlight spectrum but also not exceeding the levels that the species would encounter in the wild.

现在，虽然我们看到对UV使用的重大转变，但重要的是要记住，UV需要正确使用。这并不像只是放一个灯泡，然后在下面设置一个晒太阳的地方那么简单。如果使用不当，UV可能会造成危险，甚至会造成烧伤。那么，使用不当的危险性是什么，人们如何确保他们安全地使用UV呢？好吧，曾经有一段时间，每个人都想要越来越多的UV，这导致了问题。所有的生物，包括爬行动物和人类，都已经演化出应对他们每日环境条件的能力。在提供UV时，重要的是要在安全的水平上提供，这不仅意味着自然的阳光光谱，而且也不能超过物种在野外会遇到的水平。

There are still a few lamps out there that are not safe, mostly cheap Chinese imports sold under a brand name you might not have heard of. Some of these cheap fluorescent tubes and compacts can have flaws in the phosphor coatings that let traces of UVC through. Small halogen bulbs with no front glass are now being sold as all-in-one heat, light, and UV bulbs on platforms like Amazon and eBay, often directly from China. They emit a very unnatural spectrum with short wavelength UVB and even UVC in very narrow beams. They can also reach dangerously high temperatures.

市场上仍然存在一些不安全的灯具，大多数是廉价的中国进口品，使用你可能没听说过的品牌名称出售。这些廉价的荧光管和紧凑型灯具在磷光涂层上可能存在缺陷，会让UVC的痕迹透过。现在，没有前玻璃的小卤素灯泡正在像亚马逊和eBay这样的平台上销售，作为一体化的热、光和UV灯泡，通常直接从中国发货。他们发出非常不自然的光谱，有短波长的UVB甚至UVC在非常狭窄的光束中。他们还可能达到危险的高温。

We must also be wary of overexposure to UV, which can be harmful to both the eyes and skin. It's common sense to find out what the minimum safe distances are and ensure that the animal can't get any closer. Always provide shade and shelter from the UV, and restrict your sun-strength UVB to the basking zone only, so that you've got a gradient into shade. It is also important not to use lamps with narrow beams, as the UVB can be quite concentrated there, potentially leading to abnormal shedding, damaged skin, or even skin cancer.

我们还必须警惕UV的过度暴露，这对眼睛和皮肤都可能有害。找出最小的安全距离，并确保动物不能靠得更近，这是常识。始终提供阴凉和遮蔽UV的地方，并只将你的阳光强度UVB限制在晒太阳的区域，这样你就有了一个渐变到阴凉的区域。不要使用光束狭窄的灯具也很重要，因为那里的UVB可以相当集中，可能导致异常蜕皮、皮肤损伤，甚至皮肤癌。

Finally, I think it's important to remember that new technology will always have gaps in our knowledge until we understand how certain things work. So, at the end of the day, if you stick with the usual reptile brands, follow the packaging instructions, and provide shade, you can be pretty sure that you're providing safe amounts of UV.

最后，我认为重要的是要记住，新技术总是会在我们理解某些事物如何工作之前，让我们的知识有所不足。所以，归根结底，如果你坚持使用常规的爬行动物品牌，按照包装上的指示，提供阴凉，你可以相当确定你提供的UV量是安全的。

Thank you for the insightful conversation. For anyone looking to get in touch with me, I suggest reaching out through the Reptile Lighting Facebook forum. There's a great admin team there and plenty of knowledgeable individuals who can answer inquiries.

"Let it Go" is a really good, really nice platform. It's better to have it in public form because if someone has a question, they can search the forum. The question may already exist there, so if you do have a question, just post it publicly. Everyone will be able to contribute their opinions. In the future, when someone has the same question, the answer will already be there for them. If you go to Facebook Reptile Lighting, it'll come up. It has thousands and thousands of members now. It's a fantastic group.

"放开" 是一个非常好，非常好的平台。最好将其公开，因为如果有人有问题，他们可以搜索论坛。问题可能已经存在，所以如果你有问题，只需公开发布。每个人都将能够贡献他们的观点。在未来，当有人有同样的问题时，答案已经为他们准备好了。如果你去Facebook Reptile Lighting，它会出现。它现在有成千上万的成员。这是一个非常棒的团队。

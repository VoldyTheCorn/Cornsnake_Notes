Role: assistant
Welcome back to the Animals at Home podcast. My name is Dylan Perrin, and thank you so much for tuning in today. I am honored to be joined by Dr. Doug Mater in today's episode, and I'm also joined by Dr. Kelsey Chapman who helped co-host this episode. Many of you are familiar with Kelsey; she's been on the podcast a couple of times. I felt like having Dr. Doug Mater on, I really needed a secondary person to help me facilitate some of that vet conversation.

欢迎回到《动物在家》播客。我是主持人迪伦·佩林，非常感谢您今天的收听。在今天的节目中，我很荣幸地邀请到了Doug Mater博士，同时，我也邀请到了Kelsey Chapman博士来协助我主持这一期的节目。很多听众对Kelsey可能已经相当熟悉，她已经在播客中出现过几次。我觉得在邀请Doug Mater博士的同时，我真的需要一个协助者来帮助我进行这次的兽医对话。

There's a lot of drugs that we end up using because of anecdotal and personal information and experience. We keep using an antibiotic called Seth kazadine that we use a lot in reptiles as well. There are actually very few what are called PKPD studies, so pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic studies that look at where the drug goes in the body, to which tissues, where it concentrates in and how it kind of works.

我们使用很多药物是基于个人的经验和信息，我们一直在使用一种叫做Seth kazadine的抗生素，这种药物在爬行动物中使用的非常频繁。实际上，有关药物在体内的分布、作用于哪些组织、在哪些部位浓度最高以及其如何工作的药动药效学研究非常少。

Just to bring up a point, there's a medication called Convenia, which is suffolberson. Do you have that in Canada? We do. Yes, it's a long-acting drug that they use in dogs and cats. It's an antibiotic, and one injection, for instance in a cat, can last 10 to 12 days. So, you would think, wow, if it lasts 10 to 12 days in a cat, it's going to have to last a month in a reptile, right? Well, interestingly enough, they've given it to iguanas and, Dylan, I don't know if you're familiar with this, but take a guess, how long you think it lasts?

这里我想举一个例子，有一种药物叫做Convenia，也就是suffolberson。你们在加拿大有这种药吗？我们有的。这是一种在狗和猫中使用的长效药物。它是一种抗生素，比如说在猫身上，一次注射可以持续10到12天。那么，你可能会想，哇，如果在猫身上可以持续10到12天，那么在爬行动物身上可能会持续一个月，对吧？然而，有趣的是，他们已经将这种药物用于鬣蜥了，迪伦，我不知道你是否了解这种药物在鬣蜥身上能持续多久？

In this episode, we discussed Doug's history with reptile vet medicine, how it has evolved over the years. I mean, when I first got started, it was right around the early '80s, and there were only like three books that had been published on reptile medicine, and all of them were pretty small.

在这一期节目中，我们讨论了Doug博士在爬行动物兽医医学方面的历史，以及这个领域在过去的几年里是如何发展的。我是在80年代初开始从事这个工作的，那时候只有大约三本关于爬行动物医学的书籍，而且每本书的内容都相当简单。

We also discussed the genesis of the famous Mater's Reptile and Amphibian Medicine and Surgery textbook. He asked, "How would you like to write a chapter on drugs and drug therapy in reptiles for me?" I was like, "Oh my God, really? You want me to write a chapter for you?" He said yes, and now all of a sudden, I had a reputation overnight.

我们还讨论了著名的《Mater的爬行动物和两栖动物医学和手术》教材的创作过程。他问我：“你愿意为我写一章关于爬行动物药物和药物治疗的内容吗？”我当时的反应是：“哦，我的天哪，真的吗？你想让我为你写一章？”他回答说是的，于是我一夜之间就拥有了声誉。

We also discussed Dr. Mater's most recent book, The Vet at Noah's Ark. I really enjoyed this conversation, and I know you will as well. Here's my conversation with Dr. Doug Mater and Dr. Kelsey Chapman.

我们还讨论了Mater博士最近的一本书《诺亚方舟的兽医》。我非常享受这次对话，我知道你们也会喜欢的。下面是我与Doug Mater博士和Kelsey Chapman博士的对话。

Doug, welcome to the podcast. Thank you so much for doing this. It's such an honor and a pleasure. I really appreciate the invitation. Thank you, Dylan. Thank you, Kelsey. I'm very excited. I think your name is one of probably the top five or top 10 names that is very recognizable for reptile keepers, especially those who are not just the "I got a ball python for my birthday" type, but those who are really pushing to advance their care and trying to get down to the nitty-gritty of how we can properly care for animals.

Doug，欢迎来到播客。非常感谢你能来参加这个节目。这真是一种荣幸和快乐。我非常感谢你的邀请。谢谢你，迪伦。谢谢你，Kelsey。我非常兴奋。我想你的名字可能是爬行动物饲养者最容易认出的五个或十个名字之一，特别是那些不仅仅是“我生日收到了一个球蟒”的类型，而是那些真正推动他们的护理进步，试图深入研究我们如何正确照顾动物的人。

I also think that your last name, Mater, people just think that's the name of a textbook because they don't realize it's named after somebody, and it's the work that you've done and how influential you've been over time. I would love to set a foundation for people to kind of give people your background and your immense experience over the years.

我也认为，你的姓氏Mater，人们可能只是认为这是一本教科书的名字，因为他们没有意识到这是以某个人的名字命名的，这是你的工作，以及你多年来的影响力。我想为听众们建立一个基础，让他们了解你的背景和你多年来的丰富经验。

So, let's just start with, why did you get into vet medicine originally? What made you pursue that path? Well, it's a fun story. I'll try and keep it brief. I was born in the Florida Keys, which is a little archipelago on the very south tip of the peninsula of the mainland Florida, and my parents had the third house that was built on a small island where I was born, and our house was surrounded by mangrove swamps.

那么，让我们从最初为什么选择兽医医学开始吧？是什么让你选择了这条道路？这是一个有趣的故事。我会尽量简短地讲述。我出生在佛罗里达群岛，这是一个位于佛罗里达半岛最南端的小群岛，我的父母在我出生的小岛上建了第三座房子，我们的房子周围都是红树林沼泽。

My older brother would take me out in the mangroves, and we would slosh through the swamps and catch snakes and frogs and bugs and all sorts of fun stuff, and that's kind of how I got my initial love for the exotics and the creepy crawlies. My father was in the military, and Uncle Sam sent him off to Vietnam, and so when he was transferred to Vietnam, our family then was transferred to the state of Hawaii, where there was a military base for a lot of the military families lived, and so I kind of grew up there.

我的哥哥会带我去红树林里玩，我们会在沼泽地里跋涉，捉蛇、捉青蛙、捉虫子，做各种有趣的事情，这就是我最初对异国动物和爬行动物产生兴趣的原因。我的父亲是军人，他被派往越南，所以当他被调派到越南时，我们全家就被调派到了夏威夷，那里有一个军事基地，很多

I was in high school and uh it was the saddest day in my life when I had to sell them and move off to college so I mean they're they're pretty amazing animals they definitely are so I'm curious that I'm curious about the state of reptile medicine when you began practicing Exotics because we've seen such a steep change in it over even the last 20 years I think and obviously Kelsey have recently more recently gone through Exotics vet school but even then I think things have changed probably since you've graduated so Doug what was it like when you initially started practicing Exotics just as far as how much knowledge was around about treating these things that you know had Kelsey had mentioned there's such a vast variety of species it's almost impossible to have enough information and I imagine back then it was even more difficult oh sure um I mean when I first got started it was right around the early 80s and there were only like three books that had been published on reptile medicine and all of them were pretty small I mean very very scant there wasn't a lot of knowledge and pretty much everything in the books was anecdotal I mean there was just you know you didn't open up a page and have uh 50 references on a particular disease or a type of drug or what kind of lighting to use it was like here's what I did in my practice here's what I gave and the animal died or here's what I did in the animal lives so this must work better than the other thing did and that's pretty much the way it was um so and even at the time um the school I went to UC Davis and I think maybe one other school in the country had an actual Exotics program and most of the other schools didn't have anything at all or they might teach one or two classes a year kind of on General Exotics but there wasn't a whole lot especially with reptiles I mean the zoo world was was in pretty much in full swing and doing quite well um but you know they they mostly manage themselves around back then around the mega vertebrates and the larger larger mammals um in reptiles are just a small small part of it so yeah I mean it's I think back and I had I was fortunate enough um many people unfortunately don't remember the name Fred fry but I consider him the grandfather of reptile medicine and he wrote the first book on reptiles reptile medicine and I actually met him by accident I was at that time I I always shudder to say this because people look at me with a bad eye but my buddy and I had 67 pythons and we were raising pythons and selling them into pet trade and back then pythons were cool now you know you think about pythons you think about the Everglades and all the devastation they're doing I don't know if any of my progeny are out there causing trouble or not but uh anyway so I I was Raising pythons with my buddy to help pay for school as long as my black as well as my blacksmithing work and um I was in a bookstore one day looking at reptile books and this very tall distinguished gentleman came walking in and he started looking at reptile books and next time he started talking to each other about reptiles and I had mentioned that I had all these pythons and he got real interested he goes wow I would really love to see those and I said sure So I invited him over to to my place where I kept them and he came by and visited we were walking around I was showing things his name was Fred that's all I knew and then my buddy came down and he walked in kind of big eyed and I was kind of surprised his reaction and we chatted for a while and then my friend Fred left and my buddy goes I didn't know you knew Fred fry and I go who's Fred fry and he goes he's the guy who wrote the first reptile book so I mean he was so humble and just the nicest guy in the world and we became really good friends and here's the Godfather grandfather of reptile medicine we became friends he'd add me over for dinner he and his wife would cook for me um we would go out on his boat we'd go snake hunting whenever he had cases I'd go over to his house at night and we would do review cases so I got a chance to sit one-on-one with this amazing intellect and get some incredible um tutelage from one of the best reptile veterinarians in the world that's wonderful I feel like this this um her petticulture Society brings together people that just stick together for a long time I've been on Dylan's podcast is my third time now and we've become friends because of that and there's several other people I can name as well that I just think my goodness is so from walks of life that seem so different but in some way we're all ancient in the same way that we like those ancient Critters so I think it's really cool yeah it is you're right about um reptiles kind of bond people together that normally wouldn't be and if you don't mind I'll share a little vignette with you which please dramatically changed my career um when I was in veterinary school I mean I I I'm not one of these students that took out student loans I always worked I always had a full-time job and top of going to veterinary school so I was shooting horses working as a waiter I got a weekend job at the local primate Center at UC Davis helping out with the primates now keep in mind this was back when the human AIDS was first discovered it was back in the early 80s and I was working in a laboratory with a Dr Preston marks and he was the virologist that discovered Simeon AIDS and Simeon age is like 97 similar to human AIDS and so and they they that was discovered just uh probably a year or so after human AIDS so I always ended up working in his laboratory and keep in mind this guy's like a brilliant uh you know world-class virologist and I'm just a little peon vet student so when we'd have our team meetings you know I'm sitting in the back and peon vet students don't talk they just sit in the back and listen right and so he was during one of his seminars one day he was talking about ways to diagnose Simeon AIDS and comparing what they knew about human aids with the Simeon AIDS virus and then using the simian's virus as a model to help better diagnose human AIDS viruses and there's a test Kelsey would know what it is uh Dylan you may not have heard of it it's called hemagglutination inhibition test and that's where they take Sarah from a potentially positive viral carrier and they mix it with different red cells so it could be Pig red cells chicken red cells Fish Red cells rabbit red cells but they also use rattlesnake red cells and if they have the virus it reacts differently with the different types of cells so where am I going with this so he was this virologist was talking to the group of people one day talking about they had tried chicken they had tried rabbit they had tried these other things he goes I just need to get a hold of some fresh rattlesnake cells and so like like this is my chance okay so sheepishly I kind of raised my hand and it's like what you're just a peon vet student what are you doing raising your hand and I says I I can get you fresh rattlesnake cells and all of a sudden he goes you can and I said yes I can and he goes how I says well I'll just go up in the mountains and I'll catch you a rattlesnake I'll draw some blood I'll let the snake go I won't hurt it and then I'll give you the cells you can do that and I said yeah I can do that he goes can I go with you so it was like it turns out he was a closet snake lover too here's This brilliant brilliant scientist right but when it came right down to it he was a boy at heart he loved snakes and so I took him up to the mountains we went with our snake sticks and our snake tubes and we caught a bunch of rattlesnakes and he was blown away that I could comfortably safely catch a rattlesnake and draw blood we just did it through tubes and all of a sudden we became really good friends and I I was his best friend you know so here I am this peon vet student in this amazing man's laboratory who discovered Simeon AIDS virus right and all of a sudden like I was his coolest friend and here it is what 40 years later we're still friends that's the best part about it anyway so where am I going with this so when it came came time to graduate and go into and do your internships and residencies most veterinarians I don't know the pathway in Canada but in the United States most veterinarians graduate and then if you want to go on to Advanced Training you do an internship for a year then you apply and do a residency in a super specialty area so I had graduated I wanted to go on and obviously not horses anymore and uh this professor this this doctor came to me and he says hey I would like you to do a primate residency with me so you can continue on with the research uh with the the AIDS virus and I said well I haven't done an internship yet and he goes wink wink he goes we'll take care of that so he got me right in I graduated from veterinary school I skipped the internship went right in to do the primate Zoo residency and that's where I am today that's how I got my background in Exotics wow it was all because of a rattlesnake see this is what the young kids need to tell their moms and dads that don't want to get a snake see look at the doors that can get opened if you have you know you're at your it is true and I completely agree there's a connection that you can have with people that uh that you don't necessarily have because they're a weird you know they're sort of maligned in society so if you do find Fascination in them you kind of have this immediate Bond and and I'm curious do you think that is why there was such a void in medical information when you started was just because so few people are interested and I think that's kind of one of the themes you highlight in your book is people just sometimes don't care about reptiles and they're sort of secondary as far as well I think or medicine okay yeah you're gonna have to jump back four decades but I think you know a lot of it was there was no money in it okay and you know in order to learn and to publish you have to do research and to do research you have to have fun funding back then there was nobody that was going to give you money to study reptiles they weren't important they were studying AIDS you know I mean that was the big pushback especially back when I was getting started everything everything was focused around discovering more about the AIDS virus and so

English Version:
I was in high school, and it was the saddest day in my life when I had to sell them and move off to college. They're pretty amazing animals, they definitely are. So, I'm curious about the state of reptile medicine when you began practicing Exotics. We've seen such a steep change in it over even the last 20 years, I think, and obviously Kelsey has more recently gone through Exotics vet school. But even then, I think things have changed probably since you've graduated. So Doug, what was it like when you initially started practicing Exotics? Just as far as how much knowledge was around about treating these things. Kelsey had mentioned there's such a vast variety of species, it's almost impossible to have enough information. I imagine back then it was even more difficult.

Chinese Version:
我还在高中的时候，不得不把它们卖掉，离开去上大学，那是我人生中最悲伤的一天。它们真是令人惊叹的动物，的确如此。我对您开始从事野生动物医学时的爬行动物医学状况很好奇。我想，我们在过去的20年里看到了它的急剧变化，显然，Kelsey最近刚从野生动物兽医学院毕业。但即使是在那时，我想自从你毕业以来，事情可能已经发生了变化。那么，Doug，当你最初开始从事野生动物医学时，情况是怎样的？就像关于治疗这些东西的知识量。Kelsey曾提到，物种的种类繁多，几乎不可能有足够的信息。我想那时候可能更难。

English Version:
When I first got started, it was right around the early 80s, and there were only like three books that had been published on reptile medicine. All of them were pretty small, very scant. There wasn't a lot of knowledge and pretty much everything in the books was anecdotal. You didn't open up a page and have 50 references on a particular disease or a type of drug or what kind of lighting to use. It was like, "here's what I did in my practice, here's what I gave and the animal died, or here's what I did and the animal lived, so this must work better than the other thing did." And that's pretty much the way it was.

Chinese Version:
当我最初开始的时候，大约是在80年代初，只有大约三本关于爬行动物医学的书籍出版。它们都非常小，非常稀少。知识不多，书中的几乎所有内容都是轶事。你不会打开一页就有关于特定疾病或药物类型或应使用何种照明的50个参考。这就像，“这是我在实践中所做的，这是我给出的，动物死了，或者这是我所做的，动物活了，所以这肯定比其他事情更有效。”这就是当时的情况。

English Version:
At the time, the school I went to, UC Davis, and maybe one other school in the country had an actual Exotics program. Most of the other schools didn't have anything at all, or they might teach one or two classes a year kind of on General Exotics, but there wasn't a whole lot, especially with reptiles. The zoo world was in full swing and doing quite well, but they mostly managed themselves around the mega vertebrates and the larger mammals. In reptiles, they were just a small part of it.

Chinese Version:
当时，我所在的学校，加州大学戴维斯分校，以及国内可能还有一所其他学校有一个真正的野生动物课程。大部分其他学校根本没有，或者他们可能每年教一两个关于一般野生动物的课程，但并不多，尤其是关于爬行动物。动物园世界正在全力以赴，表现得相当好，但他们主要围绕大型脊椎动物和大型哺乳动物进行管理。在爬行动物中，他们只是其中的一小部分。

English Version:
I think back and I had, I was fortunate enough, many people unfortunately don't remember the name Fred Fry, but I consider him the grandfather of reptile medicine. He wrote the first book on reptiles' reptile medicine, and I actually met him by accident. I was at that time, I always shudder to say this because people look at me with a bad eye, but my buddy and I had 67 pythons and we were raising pythons and selling them into pet trade.

Chinese Version:
我想起了过去，我很幸运，很多人不幸地不记得Fred Fry这个名字，但我认为他是爬行动物医学的鼻祖。他写了第一本关于爬行动物医学的书，我实际上是偶然遇到他的。那时，我总是因为人们用不好的眼神看我而感到恐惧，但我和我的朋友有67条蟒蛇，我们正在饲养蟒蛇并将它们卖入宠物贸易。

English Version:
Back then, pythons were cool. Now, you know, you think about pythons, you think about the Everglades and all the devastation they're doing. I don't know if any of my progeny are out there causing trouble or not. Anyway, so I was raising pythons with my buddy to help pay for school, as well as my blacksmithing work.

Chinese Version:
那时，蟒蛇很酷。现在，你知道，你想到蟒蛇，你就会想到Everglades和他们所做的所有破坏。我不知道我是否有后代在那里制造麻烦。总之，我和我的朋友一起养蟒蛇来帮助支付学费，以及我的铁匠工作。

English Version:
I was in a bookstore one day looking at reptile books, and this very tall distinguished gentleman came walking in and he started looking at reptile books. We started talking to each other about reptiles, and I had mentioned that I had all these pythons. He got real interested, he was like, "Wow, I would really love to see those." I invited him over to my place where I kept them, and he came by and visited. We were walking around, I was showing things, his name was Fred, that's all I knew.

Chinese Version:
有一天我在书店里看爬行动物的书，一个非常高大的绅士走了进来，他开始看爬行动物的书。我们开始互相谈论关于爬行动物的话题，我提到我有所有这些蟒蛇。他非常感兴趣，他说：“哇，我真的很想看看这些。”我邀请他来我保管它们的地方，他过来参观了。我们在周围走动，我在展示东西，我只知道他的名字是弗雷德。

English Version:
Then my buddy came down and he walked in kind of big-eyed, and I was kind of surprised by his reaction. We chatted for a while, and then my friend Fred left. My buddy goes, "I didn't know you knew Fred Fry." I go, "Who's Fred Fry?" He goes, "He's the guy who wrote the first reptile book."

Chinese Version:
然后我的朋友下来，他有点惊讶地走了进来，我对他的反应有点惊讶。我们聊了一会儿，然后我的朋友弗雷德离开了。我的朋友说：“我不知道你认识Fred Fry。”我说：“谁是Fred Fry？”他说：“他是写第一本爬行动物书的人。”

English Version:
So he was so humble and just the nicest guy in the world, and we became really good friends. Here's the grandfather of reptile medicine, we became friends. He'd have me over for dinner, he and his wife would cook for me. We would go out on his boat, we'd go snake hunting. Whenever he had cases, I'd go over to his house at night and we would review cases. I got a chance to sit one-on-one with this amazing intellect and get some incredible tutelage from one of the best reptile veterinarians in the world.

Chinese Version:
所以他非常谦逊，是世界上最好的人，我们成为了非常好的朋友。这是爬行动物医学的鼻祖，我们成为了朋友。他会邀请我去吃晚餐，他和他的妻子会为我做饭。我们会去他的船上，我们会去捕蛇。每当他有案件，我会在晚上去他的家，我们会审查案件。我有机会与这个惊人的智者一对一交谈，从世界上最好的爬行动物兽医那里得到一些难以置信的指导。

English Version:
That's wonderful. I feel like this herpeticulture society brings together people that just stick together for a long time. I've been on Dylan's podcast, it's my third time now, and we've become friends because of that. There are several other people I can name as well that I just think, my goodness, it's so from walks of life that seem so different but in some way, we're all ancient in the same way that we like those ancient critters. So I think it's really cool.

Chinese Version:
这真是太好了。我觉得这个爬行动物养殖社会把人们聚集在一起，他们

----------------Original-----------------
then there was nobody that was going to give you money to study reptiles they weren't important they were studying AIDS you know I mean that was the big pushback especially back when I was getting started everything everything was focused around discovering more about the AIDS virus and so there was just no money in it so any work that was done was done and published either as case reports and they were usually very poorly peer-reviewed JFC ports because who's going to peer review something when nobody else knows anything about it either you know so they were either very poorly peer-reviewed Casey poorest or they were maybe like minor residency programs uh for instance I have a master's degree in Pharmacology that I studied a use of a drug called amication in snakes and I had to beg borrow and steal to get enough money just to run the blood samples because nobody wanted to fund it but you know back at that time I think there were three or four other studies that were published on using antibiotics in reptiles in general not just snakes now there's dozens and dozens and dozens but you know as we've progressed along there's a lot more money available a lot more interest available and of course the more people that are interested in it the more products are available if there are products that are for sale and people buying those products that makes money available so now we have the association of zoo veterinarians avian veterinarians small mammal veterinarians reptile veterinarians we have all of these amazing companies out there and a lot of them donate or dedicate some of their profits and their funds toward research and so whereas before you couldn't find money to do research now it's more and more available and of course the more you publish the more you're likely you're going to get money to do more research then you get some of these extras like Dr divers at Georgia who's got a really excellent program several interns several residence and to do a residency or to get boarded now you have to to publish papers so yeah it's logarithmically increasing the amount of knowledge that we have compared to where it was four decades ago how it's the the weird and wild that brings us together in terms of reptiles but it's also the passion that we have a good the if anything if you're because Dylan you had mentioned you know kids talk to your parents about getting reptiles whatever you have a passion for them that always has to be fostered and that passion comes through in how we all talk about these species how we talk about furthering it in different ways like with with you dealing with the hermiticulture society and taking care of these animals with us on the veterinary side we know that we need more research there and just like Doug was saying there was more always more dogs and cats as pets there's always more money in that because there's more interest but we're now seeing this shift where we understand more that there's benefits to having reptiles as pets and people are seeing that more so you can still have that human animal Bond but if you have allergies you don't have to worry about that if you need to go away for a little while or you travel a little more maybe a snake is a good option for you it's the it I can feel it now like the passion is coming out and the more popularity that we have with these Pets the better that's going to be and the better their cares going to be in the long term yeah yeah absolutely that's so true and I also would like to add I think the stigma voting over reptile has changed from you know way back when you own a snake you must be a motorcycle gang person right now it's like killing a snake oh that's really cool I mean I think a lot of that changed in the early 90s when Jurassic Park came out think about all of the pet stores that opened up selling dinosaurs and then the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles so all of a sudden they went from being these these bad animals to hey it's really cool to have one yeah absolutely and so I'm curious Doug about you know you'd mentioned when you got into there was basically three books written on the subject and and you obviously have one of these founding texts in reptile medicine it's it's a really important text and it's continued to carry on and Carry Your Name throughout the uh the decades at this point I'm I'm so curious about the writing process hey how did you decide I'm going to jump into this initially and then just tell us a little bit about the undertaking that is well let's uh step back a minute to my my colleague Dr Fred fry that I met he had written um it was a Dr Cooper from England uh Dr Marcus who was actually a veterinarian and he decided after he went to a vet school that he went back and went to medical school so he's a veterinarian and an MD and his specialty was tropical medicine and infectious disease and he always raised reptiles as a kid so again there's that connection that we all have and so he wrote a book mostly focusing on reptile diseases that were transmissible to humans and then Fred fry came along and he wrote the first book called biomedical and surgical aspects of reptile medicine and husbandry big long title um after we became friends he so he had written that one then he wrote a second book and then when I met him he was in the process of writing his last big volume and he had always written the books by himself as I mentioned before a lot of his texts pretty much all the previous textbooks were all anecdotal he was like this is what I saw in practice and and here's what I did here's what worked here so it didn't work so as I mentioned also that I had just finished this Master's thesis on pharmacokinetics in reptiles which meant that at the time I had read every single possible paper in any Veterinary tomb or uh herpetology book or Journal about drugs and reptiles so for a fry it came to me and he said Hey listen I'm finishing up my new book and he goes how would you like to write a chapter on drugs drug therapy in reptile swimming I'm like oh my god really you want me to write a chapter for you and he said yes I would love it so I did so I wrote the chapter for him which put my name in this amazing man's textbook and now all of a sudden I had a reputation like overnight and that's where it started so once I did that he decided he wasn't going to do any more book writing um elsewhere elsevier which at the time was W.B Saunders came to me at one of my I was speaking at one of the big meetings and they came to me and they said we'd really love it if you would write a textbook now that Fred fry is retired and I said well I don't I'm not smart like Fred fry I can't write a book and he goes well we we think you can and I said okay I said well I'll tell you what um if I do it I would like to reach out and bring in other experts so I would be the main editor and I'll write the book of the chapters but I want a nutritionist I want a virologist I want a dermatologist an ophthalmologist a cardiologist and they said hey that sounds great and so that's basically how that book the very first book The Black Book the first Mater which came out in the mid can't remember mid 90s 96 I think yeah thank you and so I reached out to all these experts including Michael Taylor we had talked about him earlier and I said listen I need you to write a chapter on this particular specialty that you are so good at and they did and so I don't remember how many authors I had in the first book but took about a year to get everybody to contribute their chapters and they had all they were all the top in their field and they're you know again Cardiology and oncology whatever it may be and at the time there weren't Specialists like there are now um but I did bring in all the experts and an expert is just somebody who's got a ton of experience with it as opposed to a specialist which has gone jumped through all the Hoops to take all the tests so I brought in all these experts that contributed to the first book and and that's basically how it got started that's amazing about a year yeah I mean and that's one thing I think is so important about that story too is just starting with the the Fred fry books the anecdotal information and this is actually something that Kelsey and I talk about all the time is we're in a weird point in our society where people don't believe things unless it's peer-reviewed evidence and without sort of forgetting how important anecdotal observation is and that's where you start you have to start there you can't not start there so it's just interesting to hear that Evolution start there now we're at this you know more of a you know concrete textbook but using your eyes and and writing down what you're seeing is just so crucial to even the scientific method and I see it all the time on Facebook I don't believe that unless like where's the peer-reviewed paper it's like well why don't we take a look at you know this is what I did in my animal's enclosure and this is the behavior I saw at least I can use that as a data point it's not garbage unless you know it hasn't gone through the white paper process it's just so that's it's kind of fascinating to hear that evolution of the information that's what I think it always starts oh sorry go ahead Doug no would I feel like that's where science always starts it starts with an observation it starts with the Curiosity and a curiosity is your anecdotal information and then from there you can develop a hypothesis and you can do studies based on that if you didn't have that initial curiosity based on just what you've seen through your own eyes then science would probably go nowhere so I think and that's an important Point too and I in your in your book as well Doug the vet at Noah's Ark there was a lot of personal stories about clients that have seen things in their animals and they know a lot about their own species and I feel like you did a really good job of portraying what a good vet does is we have so much that we know and it's our job to give them what we know based on studies based on things that we've learned and based on our own experience that may not be published yet but their experience matters and what they know about their animals matters too and you're always going to learn more by talking to people that like they really believe something's wrong with their animal and I just I know with experience now that you can't discount that anecdotal information that they're giving you no I absolutely 100 agree I think I think being a doctor and taking care of patients and clients is a team sport you know you're not going to do it all by yourself um I think you have to to be open and receptive and listen to what

English Version: Initially, there was no funding available for the study of reptiles. The focus was on more pressing issues like research on AIDS. As a result, any research on reptiles was often poorly peer-reviewed and published as case reports. For instance, I pursued a Master's degree in Pharmacology, where I studied the use of a drug called amication in snakes. At that time, there were only three or four other studies on the use of antibiotics in reptiles, not just snakes. Now, there are dozens of studies. As interest in this field has grown, so has the funding. The increase in interest has also led to the availability of more products for reptiles, further driving up funding. Associations like zoo veterinarians, avian veterinarians, small mammal veterinarians, and reptile veterinarians have also contributed to the funding. The more research that is published, the more likely it is to receive funding.

Chinese Version: 最初，没有资金用于研究爬行动物，因为人们的关注点更倾向于像艾滋病这样的紧急问题。因此，关于爬行动物的任何研究通常都是质量较差的同行评审，并以病例报告的形式发布。例如，我攻读了药理学硕士学位，在那里我研究了一种叫做阿米卡星在蛇中的应用。在那个时候，关于在爬行动物中使用抗生素的研究只有三四篇，不仅仅是蛇。现在，有数十篇研究。随着这个领域的兴趣的增长，资金也相应增加。兴趣的增长也导致了更多的爬行动物产品的可用性，进一步推动了资金的增加。像动物园兽医、禽类兽医、小型哺乳动物兽医和爬行动物兽医等协会也对资金有所贡献。发表的研究越多，获得资金的可能性就越大。

English Version: The passion for reptiles is what unites us. If you have a passion for reptiles, that passion needs to be nurtured. This passion is evident in how we talk about these species and the research needed in this field. There has always been more funding for research on pets like dogs and cats because of the higher interest. However, we are now seeing a shift towards understanding the benefits of having reptiles as pets. This shift is leading to better care for these animals in the long term.

Chinese Version: 对爬行动物的热情是我们团结的纽带。如果你对爬行动物有热情，那么这种热情需要被培养。这种热情在我们谈论这些物种和这个领域所需要的研究时显而易见。由于人们对宠物如猫狗的兴趣更大，所以这方面的研究资金一直较多。然而，我们现在看到的是人们对拥有爬行动物作为宠物的好处的理解正在发生转变。这种转变正在带来对这些动物长期更好的照顾。

English Version: The stigma associated with owning reptiles has changed over time. In the past, owning a snake was associated with being a member of a motorcycle gang. However, now it's considered cool to own a snake. This change in perception can be attributed to the popularity of movies like Jurassic Park and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

Chinese Version: 养爬行动物的负面印象随着时间的推移已经发生了变化。过去，拥有一条蛇被认为是摩托车帮派成员的标志。然而，现在拥有一条蛇被认为是很酷的事情。这种观念的改变可以归功于《侏罗纪公园》和《忍者神龟》等电影的流行。

English Version: When I started in this field, there were only three books written on the subject. I have contributed to one of these foundational texts in reptile medicine, which has been widely recognized. Writing a textbook was a collaborative effort. I reached out to experts in different fields like nutrition, virology, dermatology, ophthalmology, and cardiology. This collaborative approach allowed us to create a comprehensive textbook that covers various aspects of reptile medicine.

Chinese Version: 当我开始在这个领域工作时，只有三本关于这个主题的书。我为爬行动物医学的基础文本之一做出了贡献，这本书得到了广泛的认可。编写教科书是一项协作的工作。我联系了营养学、病毒学、皮肤病学、眼科学和心脏病学等不同领域的专家。这种协作的方式使我们能够创建一本涵盖爬行动物医学各个方面的综合教科书。

English Version: The importance of anecdotal observation cannot be underestimated in the scientific process. It forms the basis for developing hypotheses and conducting studies. The initial curiosity and observations are what drive scientific research. Anecdotal information from clients about their animals is also valuable. It is a team effort between the doctor, the patient, and the client to provide the best care for the animals.

Chinese Version: 在科学过程中，不能低估轶事观察的重要性。它构成了发展假设和进行研究的基础。最初的好奇心和观察是推动科学研究的动力。客户关于他们的动物的轶事信息也是有价值的。提供最好的动物照顾是医生、患者和客户的团队合作。

you no I absolutely 100 agree I think I think being a doctor and taking care of patients and clients is a team sport you know you're not going to do it all by yourself um I think you have to to be open and receptive and listen to what they have to say as well as look at your patient take all the data and put it together and that's how you're going to come up with your best chance for a diagnosis but Dylan if I could get back to one of your points and that is um just because something is peer reviewed does not necessarily mean it's accurate um our the hospital I I recently retired from daily practice but I had a private practice referral hospital and we did rounds twice a day and then every month we had Journal club and part of the journal Club was so that I could teach my visiting students and my young doctors how to properly read a journal article and assess it because just because it went through peer review and just because it's in print doesn't always mean it's right and I'll give you a quick reptile example several years ago there was a study that was printed in one of the bigger journals that talked about using a pain medication in ball pythons and what they did is they wanted to measure uh cortisol levels pre-surgery and then cortisol levels post-surgery half the group got a pain medication half the group didn't get pain medicine they got a sham and then they measured cortisol levels to compare it and after it was all said and done they compared the Sham group with the pain group they were no difference in cortisol levels and they published this paper and it said this particular drug doesn't work Kelsey I don't know if you're familiar with cortisol levels and snakes but snakes don't make cortisol they make corticost their own so of course if you measure something that's not there there's going to be no difference in either group and somehow that made it all the way through the peer review process it got put into print and now it's out there and I still see that paper cited and quoted by other people that don't know the difference or the fact that snakes don't make cortisol so just because it's in print doesn't necessarily mean that it's gospel so you do have to look at everything and evaluate everything and make sure that it's correct and then you know let's let's also look at the big picture too you have a Fred fry who was a veterinarian for 50 years maybe he never published his uh his uh responses of uh bearded dragons to um an antibiotic called baytrol okay but he's been doing it for 50 years that's an exaggeration I'm using this as an example as opposed to the resident who is required to do a resident program or a resident project and has six bearded dragons in the laboratory and they give baytroll and they came up with a result based on six bearded dragons in a laboratory in Canada as opposed to somebody in private practice who's seen hundreds if not thousands of bearded dragons over 40 years so which do you think really carries more weight so you have to look at the whole picture and look at all of the data and all the facts 100 I mean that a new a nice way of communicating with clients too in the exam room is that we have to be aware of where we got our information from and um and where we think that our knowledge deficits are I think that's a really good thing about any any professional is knowing where your deficits are we know what we do know but we also have to know what we don't know I love that saying I love that saying it's one of my favorite sayings is I and I don't mean to interrupt you but you nailed it man I feel like I know less now than I did when I first started and the more I learned the more I realize I don't know and that scares the heck out of me I think it's exciting but it is a bit terrifying in some sense it makes me I'm better at communicating with clients now being very honest about what we do and what we don't know um and also being on for them about these are the studies that we know but this was maybe done by the company that made this drug so we do have to take that with a grain of salt um but it's funny how a telephone tag kind of game gets played with this epistemological worries about where did we get this knowledge from how do we know now that this this medication might not work for pain and Stakes now you have to go back to well that wasn't the right way to do that study exactly so now we can learn from that but now we have to deal with what's come of that where everyone has the same kind of idea and going back to this idea of where did that come from in the beginning so I find that really interesting but it gets frustrating it's almost like you get into the weeds a bit you have to pull yourself back out yeah yeah and I'm curious just about drugs in general when it comes to treating reptiles I know that is somewhere that's obviously evolved over the last you know 20 30 years how different because I is my assumption from a Layman is that a lot of the drugs were originally mammal drugs that are just trying to you know transcribe them over to reptiles and I know sometimes it doesn't work sometimes it does is there a future where there's very specific or maybe it already exists where this we're creating drugs for specifically for reptiles or or does it is there is there close enough biology between mammals and reptiles where it doesn't matter um I think that's the holy grail and that is everything that's used in in snakes or any reptile right now is extrapolated from mammalian use there are there are although there are some drugs that have been studied now in reptiles thank heavens um there are no drugs that are specifically formulated for reptiles and there are no drugs that are FDA or USDA approved to be used in reptiles so everything that we use in a reptile is what we call extra or off-label um and then why because again it's a money thing um you've heard of the drug vitrol I'm sure I think everybody has right well that's that's a drug that was studied in um it was actually a human drug started as a human drug that didn't work and then they gave it to the veterinary world and it worked in dogs and so it became a popular drug in dogs and all the work done in reptile all the work for all the animals used all the doses used in reptiles came from dog doses well over the last 20 years there have been probably a dozen or so baseball studies in reptiles but there's no way you'd ever find a company that could would spend the money to Market a drug specifically for a reptile so there's just not enough money in it because the r d involved in bringing a drug to Market is millions and millions and millions of dollars they'd never recoup that right yeah we're definitely stuck in kind of like a limbo almost and just sort of having to test with our own animals because do you have anything to add to that well I mean the drug thing is interesting there's a lot of drugs that we end up using because of anecdotal and personal information and experience that we keep using as an antibiotic called cefazidine that we use a lot in reptiles as well and there are actually very few what are called pkpd studies so pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic studies that look at where the drug goes in the body to which tissues where it concentrates in and how it kind of works um so we we use Doses and we kind of use use them across reptile species but there are since there's so many different species of reptiles not to mention within that breeze or morphs and those can react very differently in dogs like there are breeds of dogs that certain drugs will be fatal for a certain breed of dog so there's just so much that we so many branches that we can go it's many places we can go in terms of reptile medicine that that's an exciting place where we don't have that much knowledge but we do have a lot more than we used to have but yeah the drug thing um sometimes you think something's gonna work and it just doesn't and it's really really frustrating and so I think we're all just waiting for more knowledge but we all have to do it together and it takes a lot of work Dylan you asked a question and I I didn't directly answer and that was about using drugs from mammals in in reptiles and does it just cross over and and the answer is we don't know in all the cases you know in a few cases we've done some studies and we're able to adapt dosages but just to bring up a point there's a medication called convenia which is umphobicin do you have that in Canada we do yes it's a long-acting drug that they use in dogs and cats and it's an antibiotic and one injection for instance in a cat can last 10 to 12 days so you would think wow if it lasts 10 to 12 Days in a cat it's going to have to last a month in a reptile right yeah well interestingly enough they've given it to iguanas and Dylan I don't know if you're familiar with this but take a guess how long you think it lasts I just want to take a short break from today's episode to thank each and every one of you for tuning in today if you would like to show more support for the podcast you can do that by checking out the show's sponsor custom reptile habitats there is an affiliate Link in both the YouTube description and the show notes if you do make a purchase through that link a commission comes back to me at no extra cost to you the other way you can show support to the podcast is through the patreon account for as little as 75 cents per episode you will automatically be added to the Discord server so you can communicate and chat with other like-minded Keepers if you do bump yourself up to the five dollar a month tier you'll have early access to the episodes and the opportunity to submit questions to upcoming guests again I am so grateful for each and every one of you this podcast is a lot of work and cost me a lot of money each month to run and any support coming from your end is greatly appreciated back to the episode I don't know I'm guessing it's short but is it just a couple of days or four hours wow yeah so that's a pretty clear example of how you can't necessarily compare Apples to Apples because it's apples to oranges so this is just a totally different it's just a totally different ability to manip or to metabolize that particular drug is is is maintained and is long acting form because the certain proteins in the blood of the dogs and the cats reptiles don't have those proteins so without those proteins the blood doesn't stick or the drug doesn't stick around there's another antibiotic we use as well called septia fear and there was a study I think it was in 2017 2018

English version:
I completely agree. I believe that being a doctor and taking care of patients and clients is a team sport. You cannot do it all by yourself. You have to be open and receptive, listen to what others have to say, examine your patient, collect all the data, and then put it together. This is how you will have the best chance of making a diagnosis.

Chinese version:
我完全同意。我认为做医生和照顾病人及客户是一种团队运动。你不能独自完成这一切。你必须要开放并接纳，听取他人的意见，检查你的病人，收集所有的数据，然后将其整合在一起。这样你才有可能做出最佳的诊断。

English version:
However, I would like to address one of your points, Dylan. Just because something is peer-reviewed does not necessarily mean it's accurate. In the hospital where I recently retired from daily practice, we had a private practice referral hospital where we did rounds twice a day. Every month, we had a journal club where I taught my visiting students and young doctors how to properly read a journal article and assess it. This is because just because an article has gone through peer review and has been published, it doesn't always mean it's correct.

Chinese version:
然而，我想回应你的一点观点，迪伦。仅仅因为某件事物经过了同行评审，并不意味着它就一定准确。在我最近从日常实践中退休的医院，我们有一个私人实践转诊医院，我们每天进行两次查房。每个月，我们都会有一个期刊俱乐部，我在那里教我的访问学生和年轻医生如何正确阅读期刊文章并评估它。这是因为，仅仅因为一篇文章经过了同行评审并已经被发表，并不总是意味着它是正确的。

English version:
For instance, several years ago, there was a study published in one of the larger journals about the use of pain medication in ball pythons. They wanted to measure cortisol levels pre-surgery and post-surgery. Half the group received a pain medication, while the other half did not and was given a sham. After it was all said and done, they compared the sham group with the pain group and found no difference in cortisol levels. The paper concluded that this particular drug doesn't work. However, snakes do not produce cortisol, they produce corticosterone. Therefore, if you measure something that's not there, there will be no difference in either group. Despite this, the paper went through the peer review process, was published, and is still being cited and quoted by others who don't know the difference.

Chinese version:
例如，几年前，有一项在较大的期刊上发表的研究，是关于在球蟒中使用止痛药的。他们想要在手术前后测量皮质醇水平。一半的组接受了止痛药，而另一半则没有，并被给予了一个假的。在一切都说完做完后，他们比较了假的组和疼痛的组，发现在皮质醇水平上没有差异。这篇论文得出的结论是，这种特定的药物不起作用。然而，蛇并不产生皮质醇，它们产生皮质酮。因此，如果你测量的是不存在的东西，那么两个组之间就不会有任何差异。尽管如此，这篇论文还是通过了同行评审过程，被发表了，而且仍然被那些不知道差异的人引用和引述。

English version:
We have to look at everything, evaluate everything, and make sure that it's correct. We also need to look at the big picture. For example, consider a veterinarian who has been treating bearded dragons with an antibiotic called Baytril for 50 years. He may not have published his findings, but he has been doing it for 50 years. This is compared to a resident who is required to do a residency program or project and has only six bearded dragons in the laboratory. They give Baytril to the dragons and come up with a result based on these six bearded dragons in a laboratory in Canada. However, the private practitioner has seen hundreds, if not thousands, of bearded dragons over 40 years. So which do you think really carries more weight? You have to look at the whole picture and all of the facts.

Chinese version:
我们必须审视一切，评估一切，并确保它是正确的。我们还需要看大局。例如，考虑一位已经用一种叫做Baytril的抗生素治疗胡须龙50年的兽医。他可能没有发表他的发现，但他已经这样做了50年。这与一名需要做住院医师项目或项目的住院医师相比，他在实验室里只有六只胡须龙。他们给龙施用Baytril，并根据加拿大实验室里这六只胡须龙得出一个结果。然而，私人执业医生在40年的时间里见过数百，甚至数千只胡须龙。那么，你认为哪个真的更有分量呢？你必须看整个大局和所有的事实。

English version:
A good way of communicating with clients in the exam room is to be aware of where we got our information from and where we think our knowledge deficits are. As professionals, we need to know what we do know, but we also have to know what we don't know. I love this saying and it's one of my favorites. The more I learn, the more I realize I don't know, and that scares me. It's exciting, but it's also a bit terrifying. It makes me better at communicating with clients, being honest about what we do and don't know, and also being upfront about the studies we know. However, we have to take into consideration that some studies may have been conducted by the company that made the drug.

Chinese version:
在诊室与客户沟通的一个好方法是，我们要清楚我们从哪里获取的信息，以及我们认为我们的知识短缺在哪里。作为专业人士，我们需要知道我们知道什么，但我们也必须知道我们不知道什么。我喜欢这句格言，这是我最喜欢的格言之一。我学到的越多，我就越意识到我不知道的东西，这让我感到恐惧。这很令人兴奋，但也有点恐怖。这使我更擅长与客户沟通，对我们知道的和不知道的事情保持诚实，并且也要对我们知道的研究保持坦诚。然而，我们必须考虑到，一些研究可能是由制造该药的公司进行的。

English version:
We also need to be aware of the "telephone tag" game that gets played with this knowledge. We need to question where we got this knowledge from and how we know that this medication might not work for pain in snakes. We have to go back to the fact that the original study was not conducted correctly. We can learn from that, but we also have to deal with the repercussions of that flawed study. It's interesting, but it can also be frustrating. It can feel like you're getting into the weeds a bit and you have to pull yourself back out.

Chinese version:
我们还需要注意这种知识中的“电话标签”游戏。我们需要质疑我们从哪里得到这个知识，以及我们如何知道这种药可能对蛇的疼痛无效。我们必须回到原始研究并未正确进行的事实。我们可以从中学习，但我们也必须处理那个有缺陷的研究的影响。这很有趣，但也可能令人沮丧。你可能会觉得自己有点陷入困境，你必须把自己拉出来。

English version:
Regarding the treatment of reptiles with drugs, I know that this has evolved over the last 20 to 30 years. My assumption, as a layman, is that many of the drugs were originally for mammals and we are trying to use them for reptiles. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I wonder if there's a future where we're creating drugs specifically for reptiles, or if the biology between mammals and reptiles is close enough that it doesn't matter.

Chinese version:
关于用药物治疗爬行动物，我知道这在过去的20到30年里已经发生了演变。作为一个外行人，我的假设是，许多药物最初是为哺乳动物准备的，我们试图将它们用于爬行动物。有时候它有效，有时候它不起作用。我想知道是否有一个未来，我们正在为爬行动物专门创建药物，或者哺乳动物和爬行动物之间的生物学是否足够接近，以至于这并不重要。

English version:
I believe that's the holy grail. Currently, everything that's used in snakes or any reptile is extrapolated from mammalian use. Although some drugs have been studied in reptiles now, there are no drugs that are specifically formulated for reptiles and there are no drugs that are FDA or USDA approved to
==============OPENAI End===========

Part: 5
----------------Original-----------------
in the blood of the dogs and the cats reptiles don't have those proteins so without those proteins the blood doesn't stick or the drug doesn't stick around there's another antibiotic we use as well called septia fear and there was a study I think it was in 2017 2018 maybe um on safety if you're in bearded dragons and it's a drug that we use much more frequently in other species like we'll use it in rabbits maybe every three to five days but they did an actual like that study I mentioned the pkpd study in bearded dragons and it lasts 12 days it seems so this and you can't just say that well this antibiotic convenient for example less less long in reptile so we'd think that maybe safety of fear would also last less long that's the opposite so there's just so much unknown wow yeah that that makes it confusing does do you guys think that reptile medicine and there's probably a question for both you it is getting to a point where subspecialties will be more prominent like a cardiologist for like an exotic or a reptile vet or oncologist or you know some we we sort of see some of that in cat and dog medicine and obviously human medicine but is there a place for that in reptile medicine in the next two decades we'll say I don't know that they'll actually have designated sub-specialties but we're definitely seeing people pursue areas of special interest a classical example would be Dr Lionel schilliger out of France and he's boarded in reptile medicine in Europe um and he loves Cardiology so he focuses a lot of his work in cardiology and reptiles and he's published some very nice papers and review articles on reptile Cardiology and he's done a great job now um because it's still in its early stages of just descriptive reptile Cardiology for example what I mean by that is ultrasound so he's done several really nice papers where he's just done amazing ultrasounds on various species of reptiles published the images done diagrams so that now if Kelsey or I were to pick up an ultrasound probe and put it on a snake and I go what am I looking at well I can pick up one of Dr schilliger's papers and say oh well that's the single ventricle and there's your you know Cavern benosum there's your your uh you know your left atrium so yeah I mean there are people that are definitely focusing in certain areas you know there's there's a couple of veterinarians in the U.S that are just really focusing on pain control um there are veterinarians that focus on virology so yeah and I think we're seeing that I don't know if or when there will ever be sub subspecialties but who knows maybe there will yeah yeah that would be I could see I mean it's still a volume problem right you need to have enough animals being brought to the clinics for this for that to happen now another interesting thing about probably reptile medicine in general maybe this interesting might not be the right word is that we know a lot of the animals being brought into clinics are husbandry errors so that people bringing them in because they haven't been caring for their animal properly and and I think this is what one of the issues with because of so many different species people keep in captivity at this point from my point of view I can't expect an exotic vet to understand husbandry for every species that comes through the door I just don't know how that would be possible or even if it's even if that's practical so do you think that husbandry is something that should be an exotic vet should have their top knowledge on all the time or do you think that there's room for like a middleman to educate husbandry so the Vets can focus on the medicine and and you know repairing and curing animals when they're sick well there's uh I think at the latest count there's 13 000 plus species of reptiles and so it's impossible I'm Kel he probably knows them but I I am certainly Far Cry from knowing all thirteen thousand and but I do think it's imperative that we as exotic animal veterinarians if you're going to say I want to start seeing Exotics I want to start seeing reptiles we know the most common ones for crying out loud you need to know your ball python your python your your red tail boa your bearded dragon your green iguana and you got to know the ones that are coming in the door every day and for the ones that don't come in the door I think it's also ethical and imperative that you tell the client I have never seen a rainbow agama before but hey let's turn around and look it up and then you turn with the client there and you you know go on the internet do a search figure it out or ask the client what do you know about this that you can share with me I can certainly sew up this suture this cut that your snake has but I don't know if there's anything special we need to know about anesthesia or I call it another reptile person who's an expert and say Hey Kelsey you know I've got blah blah blah here can you help me out what do you think have you seen these before and that's one of the nice things that that I have found in veterinary medicine is that we're all in it for the same good and I've never had anybody that I've asked for help say I'm not going to help you you know everybody wants to help each other whenever you call me I'm always happy to help so I that's the nice thing about our profession is it's full of good people it certainly is I mean just with all of vets around when you feel like you meet a vet you have that instant bond of you've gone through the similar things all this knowledge you've had to try and pack into your brain but even in the hepatic cultural Society or like us as reptile vets or amphibian vets so they're walking in the wild exotic beds even I feel like this the community gets even smaller and gets even tighter to the point where it's really nice that I can text message people that have edited textbooks now again text message the person that says John Perry who does etherealogenology section of the last edition of Mater it's like it's super helpful to be able to get there again anecdotal sometimes point of view and one thing that I remember making me think I really wanted to stay in Exotics I always kind of knew but I'd ask someone oh what do you think about this I found this like what have you seen and they said I've never seen that before good luck tell me what happens I thought that's fun yeah you get the opportunity to blaze the path and Blaze the trail a little bit and sort of flipping this concept of of just figuring out how to treat reptiles and and do reptile medicine in General on its head there's also you know Doug you kind of alluded to it with the different metabolizes and how how these animals will metabolize medications differently and whatnot there's some fascinating things about just the physiology of reptiles and in some cases we've actually been able to apply that to humans the most obvious one is Venom you know studying Venom research and using that as medications and whatnot when you look at a reptile they have an incredible ability they have a lot of them are incredible long living they have a slow metabolisms or fast metabolisms they have the ability to shut their bodies down for incredible lengths of time do you guys think that there's any areas where we can start pulling some of that information into human medicine or or more areas that because they're just these amazing creatures I mean we talk about how long they can suffer for and how stoic they are is that I think that's a quote from so you had them when we had you on the podcast originally you talked about how stoic reptiles are and how their ability to endure pain and things along those lines is there more room for pulling from reptiles into human medicine absolutely absolutely I'll give you a really classic example you take your um your leopard gecko and maybe the kids holding it he's really rough with it and the tail falls off what happens the tail regenerates so if we can study that process maybe we can start using that and apply it toward human medicine so if somebody loses a thumb or an arm or a leg maybe someday we'll figure out the genetics behind how does that leopard gecko regenerate it's slim can we apply that to humans one case that I will never ever ever forget and I don't know if this well anything will ever come of it but it's something that just left an impression on me was I had a box turtle that was hit by a lawnmower and it literally evolves the central third of its spinal cord okay I mean if you picture there's the head there's the shoulders there's the spine there's the hips there's the tail take the center of the spine and just throw it away so you have the head shoulders a little bit of spine big blank a little bit of spine hips and a tail okay I treated that animal treated the wound the beauty of reptiles is that they have something called spinal ganglia so their back feet don't need to talk to their brain in order to work so that it's basically all a reflex mechanism so an animal that's missing the center of its spine if it's alive will still walk and just the front feet will go sometimes in One Direction the back feet may not be in sync with the front feet but they do fine they can still urinate they can still defecate so the owner didn't want to give up so we treated this animal treated the wounds I covered the area and this was way back when when I used to use patches over shell deficits I don't do that anymore so I put a patch over the big section of shell where the spinal cord was missing fast forward like 10 years the animal unfortunately passed away I don't know how old it was but that thing lived 10 years like that and I asked the owner says I know this is sensitive and delicate and I says but we've been on this ride for a long time together would you be okay if I respectfully did a necropsy which is an animal autopsy on your turtle and I'll do it in such a way that you know I won't damage the shell or anything and that way you can still go ahead and have his remains back and the owner says absolutely you know absolutely you do what you need to do so I did the new creopsis animal and son of a gun and there's pictures of this in one of my textbooks the spine regenerated well the entire spine regenerated so wouldn't it be cool if we can take that knowledge and help people with spinal cord diseases yes that would be amazing axolotls have studied a lot too and uh and or in regards to human medicine and Cancers yeah that's a really great question there are a lot of things that hopefully we can extrapolate and I can't take credit for that question that's from one of my patrons who who is a doctor I think he's a pediatrician hopefully I'm getting that right so he's obviously his brain is thinking that way and uh yeah I think

In the blood of dogs and cats, there are certain proteins that reptiles do not possess. Consequently, the absence of these proteins means that the blood or drugs do not adhere as they do in mammals. We also utilize another antibiotic known as Septia Fear. A study conducted around 2017 or 2018 examined the safety of using this drug in bearded dragons, a species we often treat. In other species like rabbits, the drug is typically administered every three to five days. However, in the aforementioned study, it was found that in bearded dragons, the drug lasts for 12 days. Hence, it isn't as simple as assuming that an antibiotic will last for a shorter period in reptiles than in other animals. In fact, sometimes, the reverse is true. This lack of certainty creates a sense of confusion and intrigue.

狗和猫的血液中存在某些蛋白质，而爬行动物则不具备这些蛋白质。因此，这些蛋白质的缺失意味着血液或药物无法像在哺乳动物中那样粘附。我们也使用另一种称为Septia Fear的抗生素。大约在2017年或2018年进行的一项研究检查了在胡须龙中使用这种药物的安全性，这是我们经常治疗的一个物种。在其他物种，如兔子中，通常每三到五天给药一次。然而，在上述研究中，发现在胡须龙中，这种药物可以持续12天。因此，我们不能简单地假设抗生素在爬行动物中的持续时间会比在其他动物中短。事实上，有时候，情况恰恰相反。这种不确定性带来了一种混乱和好奇的感觉。

A question that often arises is whether reptile medicine will evolve to a point where it will have more prominent subspecialties, similar to those seen in cat, dog, and human medicine. For example, will there be cardiologists, oncologists, or other specialists specifically for exotic or reptile animals? While it's uncertain if designated subspecialties will emerge, it's obvious that professionals are pursuing areas of special interest. Dr. Lionel Schilliger from France, who specializes in reptile medicine, is a good example. He has a keen interest in cardiology and has published numerous papers and review articles on the subject.

经常出现的一个问题是，爬行动物医学是否会发展到一个地步，会有更突出的亚专业，类似于我们在猫、狗和人类医学中看到的那样。例如，会有专门针对异国或爬行动物的心脏病专家、肿瘤学家或其他专家吗？虽然我们不确定是否会出现指定的亚专业，但很明显，专业人士正在追求特殊领域的研究。法国的Lionel Schilliger博士就是一个很好的例子，他专门从事爬行动物医学，对心脏病学有着浓厚的兴趣，并已经在这个主题上发表了许多论文和综述文章。

It's important to note that a significant number of animals brought to clinics are victims of husbandry errors, meaning they have not been cared for properly. With such a vast array of species being kept in captivity, it's unrealistic to expect an exotic vet to understand the husbandry of every species. Hence, the question arises as to whether husbandry is something an exotic vet should always have comprehensive knowledge of, or if there is room for a middleman to educate on husbandry, allowing vets to focus on medicine and treatment.

值得注意的是，有大量被送到诊所的动物是饲养错误的受害者，意味着他们没有得到适当的照顾。由于有如此多的物种被关在笼子里，期望一位异国动物兽医了解每一个物种的饲养是不现实的。因此，问题就是饲养是否是异国动物兽医应该始终具备全面知识的东西，或者是否有中间人来教育饲养，让兽医专注于医学和治疗。

One of the most fascinating aspects of reptiles is their physiology. Their long lifespans, varying metabolisms, and ability to shut their bodies down for extended periods are all areas of interest. The question is, can we apply this information to human medicine? For example, when a leopard gecko loses its tail, it is able to regenerate it. If we can understand the genetics behind this, perhaps we can apply it to human medicine. Similarly, reptiles have shown the ability to regenerate their spine, which could have significant implications for treating spinal cord diseases in humans.

爬行动物最吸引人的方面之一是他们的生理机能。他们的长寿、各种代谢机制以及关闭身体的能力都是我们感兴趣的领域。问题是，我们能把这些信息应用到人类医学中吗？例如，当豹纹守宫失去尾巴时，它能够再生。如果我们能理解这背后的遗传学，也许我们可以将其应用到人类医学中。同样，爬行动物已经显示出再生脊柱的能力，这对于治疗人类脊髓疾病可能有重大影响。

of things that hopefully we can extrapolate and I can't take credit for that question that's from one of my patrons who who is a doctor I think he's a pediatrician hopefully I'm getting that right so he's obviously his brain is thinking that way and uh yeah I think that that is a fascinating area of study and it is bizarre to think I mean here we are as humans if our teeth break it's like there you go you're done with your teeth you don't get them back there's Turtles out there growing their spines back it's it's pretty incredible you're in Florida Doug so you're kind of at the epicenter of reptile regulation and so I wonder what your opinion is on on just regulating our the community in general as far as keeping reptiles because Florida is a poster child for how things can kind of go wrong as far as invasive species and whatnot but so some people think we they shouldn't be kept at all some people think that there should be some regulation I don't know what to think because I always think government regulation pretty much never goes as they plan it so that I'm kind of I'd be worried about that but from your point of view do you think that there needs to be more done as far as regulating how people are keeping their reptiles I think it's become such a political Quagmire right now Dylan that I don't I don't know I mean I it's very distressing for me as a person who loves reptiles and values their importance in the human animal Bond um as with most anything it's I think it's definitely the small majority or small minority of people that are irresponsible that are causing the vast majority of the problems and you can extend that to let's say pit bulls okay I love pit bulls they're great dogs I have one but they have a bad rep because the very few people that are irresponsible in how they own them it makes the dog breed look bad so it's the same thing with reptiles you get the occasional idiot who decides to let their black and white Tegu loose in the Everglades and look at the problems it makes so I I do agree with some regulation I think that's extremely important but they've gone too far in the State of Florida in my mind whereas you can't own a green iguana you can't own a Tegu you can't own a Burmese python and why is that fair you know I mean yes these are potentially Troublesome animals but at the same time you can make the argument that never let your cat outside because it's going to eat the wild birds never let your dog loose because it's going to attack the local skunk you know it's so I do think at least in the State of Florida they've gone too far but it's all being motivated by politics not by scientific reason yeah yeah that's definitely true Kelsey do you have anything to add to that it's the same thing I mean in in Alberta we uh rats are legal in BC and they're also legal in Saskatchewan but they don't cross the border I guess they stop at the border uh and I get the I get the reasons politically farming I totally understand but I mean I love seeing rats I don't get to see them in practice there's lots of reptiles that we can't have here as well lots of different animals and I totally agree with Doug I guess I just basically reiterate that there's I understand the need for regulation I do think there should be some but they're it's a good thing that we have societies to try and push back and to try and bring light to you know there's there's a human animal Bond here between all these different species and we want to Foster that and they and they can get proper care um it's it's unfortunate but that is kind of how Society Works in terms of balancing freedoms and balancing safety for everybody um that it's it's unfortunate now that I feel like governments I don't know if it's been a slow Trend towards this but I sometimes I feel a little bit less listened to I feel like I can get on boards and deal with um her Horticulture societies and I just don't feel like there's an actual give and take relationship in terms of government oversight and what the people want to talk about and I feel like that's a big disconnect I feel like there's so much to learn from each other and so much to help and so much too we can help the governments do things that actually make the people happy but that make everybody happy on both sides and I feel like that open discussion is really important and I miss that sometimes yeah yeah absolutely well Doug let's talk a little bit about your new your latest book the vet at Noah's Ark and maybe you could just start with tell us about what what motivated you to write it well thank you um yeah you know I've I've written three textbooks uh and I thoroughly enjoyed that and that was a labor of love to give back to and share with my colleagues but ever since high school when I was working with the veterinarian and he gave me the first copy of James Harriet I said you know two things I want to do in life one is I want to be a James Harriet and the other one is I want to write a book because I mentioned I love to read when I was growing up and I still do and when I read his books and he is such an amazing Storyteller and I said you know someday I want to do that and so even back in high school I started taking creative writing classes and I've always been a writer my teacher in high school said if you want to be a writer someday you need to keep a journal you have to write at least one page a day and so I've pretty much done that and you know there may be a three or four days or a week that goes by that I don't get a chance to write but then I'll sit down and I'll write six or seven pages um so I've always kept journals I've always been writing the other thing this person told me was if you can't call yourself a writer until you've published a million words well unfortunately I've I've probably done that two or three times over now but when I finally decided to retire from general practice I still have a small boutique practice I've got some uh facilities like alligator farms and you know zoos and Aquariums that I take care of but I don't do private clients anymore that is okay it's time for me to start writing so I finally sat down pulled out all my old Journal notes and uh started pending the book and uh you know I was motivated by James Harriet so that's that's what got it started did you find Doug that when you were um writing in your journals that you're mostly writing stories of the day or were you writing like you get up and just get whatever comes out conscious flow kind of writing or however you writing uh no uh cases okay I I kept it really good detail in most of my cases because I knew someday they'd come in handy and it's interesting how I go back and we were talking earlier about anecdotal and I think you know I've never seen that published but wait a minute and I'll dig through some of my notes and go yeah you know I saw a case of this and this is how I treated it oh it died but I learned okay yes this is what didn't work and sometimes what doesn't work is just as important as what does work but by doing that you know all of those cases and you know you you said you read my book you know all those cases came with an owner or a situation and so it made it real easy for me to put together the facts in the book because everything in the book is 100 real with the exception I changed names for privacy sakes for a lot of people but it's all real and and I was able to have that documentation because I kept all those notes over the years in all so many cases and and then and all honestly too every once in a while I'd have a client that would come in that was so bizarre I'd have to write about them just so that I didn't want to forget all the details yes yeah and I think that's honestly such a good tip for people just in life is to to spend some time journaling and writing just writing whether it's you know like Kelsey said just writing out the day or conscious flow whatever it is or because a you can go back on these things and who knows what kind of gold you have written down over the years like you that you basically wrote a book with that sort of thing but just for your mind I think it's good to get stuff out on paper and just just write and so so for for those who haven't read the book can you tell us just a little bit about the just the general story sure absolutely um the books the book occurs over the period of one year and it so happens to be the year that I decided to sit for and take my specialty boards the American Board of Veterinary practitioners and at the time it was called Companion Animal Practice uh no longer now it's called dog and cat but at the time it was called Companion Animal Practice and the reason I wanted to do that was because I was actively writing in journal articles and doing a lot of lecturing and everything else but it was just Doug Mater Ms DVM no Specialties and I noticed when I'd go to these different conferences and bless their souls you know you you would be speaking on programs with these amazing veterinarians birdsurgents and shirtings and people like that and that were you know single boarded double boarded and and if you didn't have boards they didn't really give you the time of day they didn't give you any credit of having any knowledge base but keep in mind I just finished a primate Center residency where I was taught by MDS I went to rounds at the medical school I was taught my surgery skills by human surgeons I was taught my endoscopy skills my my Cardiology skills everything that I learned at the primate Center was through the medical school not the veterinary school so I could I always felt that I had a pretty strong background in training and skill sets and knowledge base but nobody cared because I wasn't boarded so I said okay I want to get bored and they didn't have a board in exotic animals at the time so I want to get boarded so I have credentials to go along with my teaching in exotic animals so the book basically is about the year that I studied for it and I know that sounds really boring but that was just the back story the book is really about the human animal Bond and it's a celebration of the human animal Bond across many different species and and it's a celebration of dedication by the people that worked with me in my hospital and how it just amazingly conscientious and dedicated they were toward preserving that human animal bond to the point where they would put them physical self In Harm's Way I had one I don't want to

There are numerous fascinating topics to discuss, and I must credit one of my patrons, who happens to be a doctor, possibly a pediatrician, for one such question. His mind, as a medical professional, naturally leans towards these types of inquiries. The topic of his question is particularly intriguing. It's about the ability of some creatures, like turtles, to regrow parts of their bodies, like their spines. This is a fascinating area of study. If we humans lose a tooth, for example, it’s gone for good. Yet, there are turtles out there growing their spines back. It's truly incredible.

Chinese Version:
有很多引人入胜的话题可以讨论，其中一个问题我必须归功于我的一位赞助人，他恰好是一位医生，可能是儿科医生。作为医学专业人士，他的思维自然倾向于这些类型的查询。他提出的这个问题的主题特别引人入胜。这是关于一些生物（如乌龟）重新生长身体部位（如脊柱）的能力。这是一个令人着迷的研究领域。例如，如果我们人类失去一颗牙齿，那么它将永远消失。然而，有些乌龟正在重新生长他们的脊柱。这真的令人难以置信。

English Version:
Now, Doug, you're based in Florida, which is somewhat of a hub for reptile regulation. I'm curious about your perspective on the regulation of our community, particularly in terms of keeping reptiles. Florida has had its share of issues with invasive species, making it a prime example of the potential drawbacks of inadequate regulation. Opinions vary widely on this issue. Some people believe that reptiles shouldn't be kept at all, while others think that there should be some level of regulation. Personally, I'm unsure, as I've found that government regulations often don't work out as planned. From your point of view, do you think there needs to be more done in terms of regulating how people keep their reptiles?

Chinese Version:
现在，Doug，你在佛罗里达州，这里是爬行动物管理的一个中心。我对你对我们社区的管制，特别是在饲养爬行动物方面的看法感到好奇。佛罗里达州在入侵物种问题上有过一些问题，使其成为缺乏适当管制可能带来的潜在弊端的一个主要例子。对此问题的看法各不相同。有些人认为根本不应该饲养爬行动物，而另一些人认为应该有一定程度的管制。就我个人而言，我并不确定，因为我发现政府规定往往并不会按计划进行。从你的角度来看，你认为在规定人们如何饲养爬行动物方面需要做更多的事情吗？

English Version:
This issue has become a political quagmire. It's distressing to me, as someone who loves reptiles and appreciates their importance in the human-animal bond. Like many issues, it's often a small minority of irresponsible individuals causing the majority of the problems. This can be compared with pit bulls, for instance. They are great dogs, and I own one myself, but they have a bad reputation due to a few irresponsible owners. The same applies to reptiles. An occasional irresponsible owner who releases their black and white Tegu into the Everglades can cause significant problems. I do agree with some level of regulation, but I believe it has gone too far in Florida. It's not fair that you can't own a green iguana, a Tegu, or a Burmese python. All animals can potentially cause problems, but it's important to balance that with the benefits of pet ownership. I believe that in Florida, the regulations have been driven more by politics than by scientific reasoning.

Chinese Version:
这个问题已经变成了一个政治泥潭。对我来说，作为一个爱爬行动物并欣赏它们在人与动物之间的纽带中的重要性的人，这是令人痛心的。就像许多问题一样，通常是少数不负责任的个体造成了大部分问题。举例来说，就像比特犬。它们是伟大的狗，我自己就养了一只，但是由于少数不负责任的主人，它们的名声不好。爬行动物也是如此。偶尔有不负责任的主人把他们的黑白鬣蜥放入大沼泽地，可能会造成严重的问题。我同意一定程度的管制，但我认为在佛罗里达州已经过头了。不能拥有绿鬣蜥、鬣蜥或缅甸蟒蛇是不公平的。所有的动物都可能带来问题，但是平衡宠物拥有的好处是很重要的。我认为在佛罗里达州，这些规定更多的是由政治驱动

a celebration of dedication by the people that worked with me in my hospital and how it just amazingly conscientious and dedicated they were toward preserving that human animal bond to the point where they would put them physical self In Harm's Way I had one I don't want to give away names or be a plot spoiler but I had one of my staff members was stabbed uh you know we had a client that was killed um I mean there was some pretty significant drama living in the Inner City because it happened to overlap at the same time of the social unrest during the Rodney King riots and so it was pretty rough and my staff I they were just so brave that they in in even in spite of everything that was going on that was so horrible they still showed up for work every day and still took care of all of these animals so the course of the book starts with me basically submitting my application and it ends with me getting notification that I passed the test and again it was just all the day-to-day trauma and drama of what goes on inside of busy Inner City Hospital during that time so it's filled with a lot of anecdotes a lot of really happy anecdotes but it's a real book so there are some sad anecdotes in there because as we all know not every case turns out well um but I think overall it's a pretty enjoyable read I'm humbled it's it's won three really amazing Awards the biggest of which was the 2023 independent book award the winner for non-fiction which just blew me out of the water um it's been likened by a lot of critics as the first American James Harriet um and made New York Post uh required reading lists so I've been super thrilled at the response it's gotten that's great this thank you so much for writing this book I we had talked earlier about how I'm a clinic owner in in Alberta and a lot of these stories resonate with with me but they would have also resonated with me before I became a vet um and they will resonate with anyone who's ever had an animal or really any one who just lives and understands that there's other creatures that are alive that we're all living together for I um it was not an easy read in terms of it's simple but it was so easy for me to intake all of it it was one of those books where when you when you get to like that hour mark of sitting in the same spot you could keep going for the next couple hours so I do recommend anybody to take this book up and read it whether you're a vet or not a vet um one part I wanted to ask you about you lift the veil a little bit in there and I can't tell if it's just because of who we are as vets or if it was purposeful lift the veil of what it's like to actually be a vet in your private life so you were talking about how you and your wife were kind of ships passing in the night how um there were lots of things that you took solace in like going for walks with your dog because being a vet is is a hard it's a hard job what what what are your thoughts on how vet life has changed because you have people living at the hospital back then like your whole life was was being a vet I feel like sometimes there may be a shift towards being a vet is just a career for some people and no longer our lives do you feel that in how Society has changed over the last 10 20 years I do think so and you know this is a great subject for another podcast down the road but I you know for me being a veterinarian is a lifestyle it was something I wanted to I wanted to live and and I have lived that and um that's always been extremely important to me it's not a nine to five job um you know you always hear this term work-life balance and I think that's extremely important you need to take care of your mental health and and you you nailed it um you know my my wife was a emergency room nurse and she loved the adrenaline being an emergency room nurse and she worked the graveyard shift and I did my apply applied my in my my job during the day so pretty much you know I'd be driving home and I'd wave out the car as she was driving past on her way to work and we were lucky if we would get you know one or two days off a month where we had the same time off together and so my dog was my best friend and you know at night I would take him for his walks and we would go to the park and then I would talk to him and he would always listen my best friend because he never passed judgment he never criticized me he was always there for me he was my bodyguard because it was a pretty crappy part of town where we lived and you know I always joke that if you're carrying a gun underneath your coat and you walk down the street nobody knows you have it they're going to come up and give you a hard time until you pull the gun out if you're walking down the street with a big black dog everybody gets off the curb and gives you birth because they don't go anywhere near you so like I said he was my best friend my Confidant My Bodyguard and uh the human animal Bond was strong you know and and uh you're right but getting back to the work-life balance thing I love what I do 40 years into this I still love what I do and so to me going to work is not work I love what I do and I love helping people and I love promoting that human animal Bond and if I can save an animal and keep that Bond going strong I'm doing the happy dance all the way home um I don't need to take trips to India and I don't you know and that kind of stuff but to me that's not important um now that I've retired um I've always owned my money and I think that's extremely important because everybody worries about debt and student debt and stuff like that but you can either have money or you can own your money and if you own your money means you make the money work for you so all throughout my career I've been very careful about Investments and doing things properly now that I'm retired I have my work-like balance if I want to go to India I go to India but I fly first class you know I don't need to sit in the back of the bus and stay in hostels um so my work-life balance is here I'm perfectly happy and I wouldn't change a thing how I did it but that's not the way a lot of the younger vets are trained nowadays but to me veterinary medicine for me is always a calling you know it was a lifestyle yeah and one more follow-up question to that you had a story in your book about a student that wasn't it wasn't going very well she didn't seem like she was trying very hard um like she was really interested do you find that happens more nowadays and I my anecdote is I see that a little bit more nowadays um because I now train students that come through my veterinary hospital and it just seems like there isn't that I don't know if the passion is gone or if just life has gotten harder or is that something that you think is happening more nowadays oh I do and I think it's being taught that way too I I um I mean right before I retired uh I I've always had students for as long as I can remember and I remember before I retired the last couple years when the students would come out with their paperwork I would frequently get these uh instructions from their schools that Sally or Joe or whoever uh they need to do eight to five they shouldn't be expected to come in after five they shouldn't be expected to do emergencies if I notice that they're stressed I should give them time off to to to regroup and calm down and I'm thinking I'm sorry you know if the client's upset if a pet is dying at a quarter to five I'm not going home at five o'clock I'm staying there until that pet is stable and I can hand it off to an emergency doctor or the next shift you know I don't quit at the end of the day just because I'm tired and I definitely see that they're taught a different framework than at least I was taught when I was coming up yeah yeah I see that as well and I get I think the underpinnings um idea for that is is a good one I think that they want to make sure that everyone is being it is okay but I worry that with the coddling of that that we might create um people that are less able to deal with what stresses that veterinary medicine does actually bring because my goodness like you get bombarded with things every day all day and then if you be an owner or even if you're just working in a clinic there's also the people personalities to deal with the inter-hospital kind of stuff so I think I think it's nice to to control it so we can minimize the stress but you also have to be trained to handle it when it's there and I think one of the words I use a lot is being prepared right you know I live in a hurricane prone area I can't stop hurricanes I know they're out there but if I'm prepared I'm going to be able to handle them much better than if I'm not prepared 100 yeah yeah absolutely it's about slowly being being able to handle more and more stress over time and and if you wanted to just pretend that hurricanes don't happen then when the hurricane does come you'll be standing in your living room and there'll be no living room you know so and maybe some of those individuals maybe shouldn't go into veterinary medicine if they do if they can't handle that stress that could be a you know another side of it as well and I'm curious you know vet burnout is a is a pretty prominent term people hear that vet burnout or compassion fatigue Doug you've been a vet for how how long has it been um God almost 40 years 40 years so how do you avoid that or how do you you know bolster yourself against falling into the ditch of of compassion fatigue and whatnot I think the real important thing is is to number one admit that it's going to happen okay everybody is susceptible to it um If you deny it then when it happens you're willing to be in for a shock the other thing is surround yourself with a good support network um I can you know I I can tell you right now that I have a feeling that if I ever needed something I could call you and you'd pick up the phone or I could call Kelsey and likewise if you needed something you could call me anytime you surround yourself with a good support network and then if you needed to it you can lean on them but likewise they know that if they need you they can lean

The text reflects the speaker's admiration and gratitude for his hospital staff's dedication and conscientiousness in maintaining the human-animal bond. Despite the physical danger and the challenging social environment marked by the Rodney King riots, his staff displayed remarkable bravery. They showed up for work daily, providing care for the animals amid the traumatic and dramatic day-to-day experiences of a busy inner-city hospital. The speaker's book chronicles his journey from submitting his application to receiving his test results, peppered with a mix of happy and sad anecdotes. The book has been well-received, winning three awards, including the 2023 Independent Book Award for non-fiction. The speaker also draws attention to the rigours of being a vet, discussing the challenges of maintaining a work-life balance and how the profession has evolved over the years. He emphasizes that for him, being a veterinarian is a lifestyle, not just a job, and discusses the importance of financial independence. The speaker also comments on the changing attitudes of new veterinarians, suggesting that the profession is losing its passion and dedication. He believes that while it is crucial to manage stress, the profession's inherent challenges require resilience and preparedness.
该段文字反映了发言者对他的医院工作人员在维护人与动物的联系方面表现出的敬业精神和良知的赞赏和感激。尽管面临身体危险和罗德尼·金暴动带来的社会环境挑战，他的员工表现出了显著的勇敢。他们每天都会上班，尽管在繁忙的市区医院中每天都会经历各种各样的创伤和戏剧性的经历，他们还是为动物提供了照顾。发言者的书记录了他从提交申请到收到测试结果的过程，并点缀了许多快乐和悲伤的轶事。这本书受到了广泛的好评，赢得了三个奖项，其中包括2023年的独立图书非小说类奖。发言者还谈到了兽医的严谨，讨论了保持工作生活平衡的挑战以及这个职业多年来的演变。他强调对他来说，做兽医是一种生活方式，而不仅仅是一份工作，并讨论了经济独立的重要性。发言者还评论了新兽医的态度变化，认为这个职业正在失去其热情和奉献精神。他认为，尽管管理压力很重要，但这个职业固有的挑战需要有韧性和准备。

The speaker goes on to discuss an anecdote from his book about a student who seemed uninterested and unengaged. He expresses concern that this lack of passion and dedication is becoming more common among new veterinarians. He also mentions the advice given by schools to new vets about maintaining regular working hours and taking time off when stressed. The speaker disagrees with this approach, believing that a vet's commitment to their patients should not be constrained by working hours. The speaker also talks about the concept of "compassion fatigue" or "vet burnout," which he believes everyone in the profession is susceptible to. To combat this, he suggests admitting its inevitability, surrounding oneself with a good support network, and being available for others in the network.
发言者接着讨论了他在书中关于一个看似不感兴趣和不参与的学生的轶事。他表示担忧，这种缺乏热情和奉献精神的情况在新的兽医中越来越常见。他还提到了学校对新兽医的建议，比如保持规律的工作时间，压力大时休息一下。发言者不同意这种做法，他认为兽医对患者的承诺不应受工作时间的限制。发言者还谈到了"同情疲劳"或"兽医疲劳"的概念，他认为这个职业的每个人都可能遭受这种疲劳。为了对抗这种疲劳，他建议承认它的不可避免性，为自己建立一个良好的支持网络，并为网络中的其他人提供帮助。

the phone or I could call Kelsey and likewise if you needed something you could call me anytime you surround yourself with a good support network and then if you needed to it you can lean on them but likewise they know that if they need you they can lean on you and if you have that support network set up and established and you're aware of the fact that someday you may need it and don't be afraid and don't be ashamed if you ever need to ask for help it's okay you know I mean everybody has things go wrong every I think everybody has a bad day and it's nothing to be ashamed of if you have to say God Dylan you know this client's really upset with me because I gave their bearded dragon Ivermectin and it died you know you know it's even if you don't know what to do the fact that you can sit there and listen to me and help me get it off my chest and it makes all the difference in the world and so again having a really good support network and being there for your friends and they're there for you um it really makes all the difference it really does yeah 100 I think that there's there's ways you can spend your time you can spend your time being worried about money or being worried about status and I've always thought that spending your time building a relationship with people is going to help you the most because at the end of the day who knows what's going to happen financially who knows what's going to happen with the world but if you have spent that time building really good relationships and being there for people and they can be there for you it's like building a community I think that really matters absolutely yeah yeah yeah yeah that's so true and and that's what's great about the book is you kind of get some insight on what it's like to have those hard days and be exhausted and have to you know still show up for your clients and and but I think highlighting the human animal bond is so important especially right now as you know I kind of alluded to earlier we're having pressure from animal rights groups and whatnot that you know people shouldn't keep Exotics for example where a lot of times people who aren't in our community don't see how there could be a human animal bond between me and a snake and and I think that's what's great about the book as well you highlight these examples of people who how important and a pet snake can be to somebody you know it is so people who don't keep snakes might not understand but it can be just as important as as your dog and and people and that will allow us to sort of build a more of a respect for people who have a human animal bond with an animal that isn't one of the conventional pets you know cat or dog yeah I I don't know that we can put a label on the human animal Bond and say it's only for cats dogs and horses because it crosses species and again a quick personal example um I adopted a California Desert Tortoise when I was a student a Veterinary student and so you can you know that was a long time ago and I'd had it it and I'd estimated it was about 57 years old and I think I had it for about 35 years so that animal was part of my life for 35 years every day for 35 years I get up I where I live I bring them to a bedroom at night and take them out during the day I feed it I water it I clean it um and eventually it ended up getting liver cancer and so I did the endoscopy on it I saw it I took biopsies on it I just about died um got the results back he came back cancer and I didn't want to let him suffer so I gave him hospice care until he was no longer comfortable and I had to put him down I was a mess absolute mess I mean how do you have something in your life for 35 years and all of a sudden it's not there anymore you know and think that it's not going to affect you so you know people have dogs and cats for 10 15 maybe 20 years that's a long time have something for 35 years and I know people who have I I have clients who have tortoises that have been in their family for over 100 years documented passed down from Grandfather to father to son and how can you not have a bond or something like that absolutely yeah I mean I think about even my crested gecko he was he hatched in o5 and I had I bought him in 07 you know so I've had him for you know it's it's an incredible amount of time and I was just saying that to my wife the other day I'm like isn't it crazy for the past basically 15 or 16 17 years I've fed this animal you know every couple of days like it's just it just becomes part of your routine that you don't even realize you're doing it but you're caring for this animal it's like yeah I I go back to being in grade 11 and that's when I got that animal and I'm not you know now I have a child of my own and I have a career it's just it's crazy how and that's the special thing about reptiles is so many of them are so long-lived that they come along with your entire journey of your life or like you said a dog might only live 10 years you know it's still an amazing pet an amazing Bond you can have but a reptile will really span right through your entire Journey which is really cool yeah well I give you an idea how important they are at least in my life is my wife and I were considering moving um and just recently and we have we still have three tortoises and two of them have had more more than 30 years and where we wanted to go it wouldn't be an appropriate environment for the tortoises well this particular house had a huge basement so yeah I could set up a vivarium and I could put in UV lights and sand and dirt and sod and everything else but these guys have lived outside for 30 years and we go we can't make these animals live indoors and we're not going to give them away I'm not going to give them what's like say with your you said you have a child and so you're going to go I want to move but inconvenient to have kids so I'll just give them away no so we said okay we're not going to move we're going to stay here we're going to keep to keep the tortoises and stay right where we are I mean that's how important they are to us yeah absolutely yeah there's definitely many reptile Keepers out there who when they're looking to buying a new house the first thing is okay where would the reptiles go and if this house doesn't have a good appropriate reptile room it's like it's off the list yeah absolutely makes sense this was a fantastic conversation Doug I'm so happy you wrote that book like you said I think it's obviously more accessible to people than a Veterinary textbook because you'd be surprised how many of the listeners actually have a version or an edition of the textbook but but that's not that you know it's you want to have some interesting reading where you can sit down and really absorb a story and I think that's what your your latest book does is there any last words from either of you that you want to say before we officially wrap up now I just want to say thank you very much for the opportunity to be with you both and uh I I absolutely love Canada I've been up there numerous times lecturing on vacation doing photography uh the people are always wonderful and uh again thank you so much uh you're very gracious and I'm always here if you ever need anything you can give me a call and maybe we can carry on one of these other side conversations sometime down the road yeah yeah I'd be so happy to be included in that thank you so much Dylan for for having me on and I've I've met you only briefly Doug but it's an honor to be to be allowed to interview you so this is going to be something I'll remember I'm sure we'll run into each other down the road here real soon absolutely and Doug before we let you go can you let everybody know where they can pick up the book oh thank you um you can go amazon.com has it Amazon Canada has it um you can go right to my website www.dugmater.com and you can order it from there through several different vendors um and then a lot of the uh brick and mortar stores like Barnes and Noble also carry it and you can get it I don't know if they have them in Canada Target and Walmart they both carry this the book so it's it's widely available on the internet excellent all right well Doug this was an honor and a pleasure to have you on so thank you so much thank you both very much take care and that is the end of that episode Dr Mater thank you so much for joining us on the podcast as I said through the intro you are a staple name in her petticulture community so it was just fascinating hearing your origin stories and how you've evolved over time and listening to some of that sort of nuances about reptile medicine is just absolutely fantastic Dr Kelsey Chapman thank you so much for jumping on as a co-host I think this is the first podcast he's probably co-hosted and I think you crushed it and it was just so much easier and allowed me to sit back I can kind of enjoy some of the podcasts as well rather than panicking about trying to figure out how I'm going to have a complicated technical conversation with a really well-known vet I got to just sit back and put the pressure on you to do that so thank you so much for doing that as well listeners if you did enjoy the episode make sure you share it on social media Facebook Instagram however you like I do my best to repost and re-share any of those shares on Instagram so that really does go a long way if you are interested in helping support the podcast you can do that at patreon.com animals at home if you would like to know where I got these incredible enclosures behind

Role: assistant
English:
Firstly, I could phone Kelsey if needed, and likewise, you could call me anytime. Surround yourself with a good support network. If you needed to, you could lean on them. But likewise, they know that if they need you, they can lean on you. If you have that support network set up and established, and you're aware of the fact that someday you may need it, don't be afraid and don't be ashamed if you ever need to ask for help. It's okay, you know. I mean, everybody has things go wrong. Everybody has a bad day. It's nothing to be ashamed of if you have to say, "God, Dylan, this client's really upset with me because I gave their bearded dragon Ivermectin and it died." Even if you don't know what to do, the fact that you can sit there and listen to me and help me get it off my chest makes all the difference in the world.

Chinese:
首先，如果需要，我可以打电话给Kelsey，同样，你也可以随时打电话给我。建立一个良好的支持网络，如果需要，你可以依赖他们。但同样地，他们知道如果他们需要你，他们可以依赖你。如果你建立并维护了这样的支持网络，并且你意识到总有一天你可能需要它，那么如果你需要寻求帮助，不要害怕，也不要感到羞愧。这是可以的，你知道。我的意思是，每个人都会有事情出错，每个人都会有糟糕的一天。如果你不得不说，“天哪，Dylan，这个客户真的对我很生气，因为我给他们的胡须龙喂了Ivermectin，结果它死了。”即使你不知道该怎么做，你能坐在那里听我说话，帮助我把事情说出来，这就已经使得整个情况有了很大的改变。

English:
So, again, having a really good support network and being there for your friends, and they're there for you, it really makes all the difference. It really does. Yeah, 100%. I think that there's ways you can spend your time. You can spend your time being worried about money or being worried about status. I've always thought that spending your time building a relationship with people is going to help you the most. Because at the end of the day, who knows what's going to happen financially? Who knows what's going to happen with the world? But if you have spent that time building really good relationships and being there for people, and they can be there for you, it's like building a community. I think that really matters.

Chinese:
所以，再次强调，拥有一个很好的支持网络，为你的朋友们在那里，他们也会为你在那里，这真的会有很大的不同。这是真的。是的，百分之百。我认为有很多种方式可以花费你的时间。你可以花时间去担心钱或者担心地位。我一直认为，花时间去建立与人的关系会对你最有帮助。因为到头来，谁知道会发生什么财务问题？谁知道世界会发生什么？但是如果你花时间去建立良好的关系，为人们在那里，他们也可以为你在那里，这就像是建立一个社区。我认为这真的很重要。

English:
Absolutely, yeah. That's so true. And that's what's great about the book. You kind of get some insight on what it's like to have those hard days and be exhausted, and have to, you know, still show up for your clients. But I think highlighting the human-animal bond is so important, especially right now. As you know, I kind of alluded to earlier, we're having pressure from animal rights groups, and whatnot, that people shouldn't keep Exotics, for example. Where a lot of times, people who aren't in our community don't see how there could be a human-animal bond between me and a snake.

Chinese:
绝对的，是的。这是如此的真实。这也是这本书的优点。你可以从中得到一些洞察，了解那些艰难的日子和疲惫是什么样的，你知道，还必须为你的客户出现。但是我认为，强调人与动物的纽带是如此重要，尤其是现在。如你所知，我之前有所提及，我们正面临动物权利团体的压力，等等，例如，人们不应该养殖异国动物。很多时候，我们社区之外的人们看不到我和一条蛇之间可以有人与动物的纽带。

English:
And I think that's what's great about the book as well. You highlight these examples of people who show how important a pet snake can be to somebody. It is so. People who don't keep snakes might not understand, but it can be just as important as your dog. And people, and that will allow us to sort of build a more of a respect for people who have a human-animal bond with an animal that isn't one of the conventional pets, you know, cat or dog.

Chinese:
我认为这也是这本书的优点。你强调了这些例子，这些例子显示了一条宠物蛇对某人的重要性。这是如此。不养蛇的人可能无法理解，但它可能和你的狗一样重要。这将使我们能够对那些与非传统宠物，例如猫或狗，建立人与动物纽带的人建立更多的尊重。

English:
Yeah, I don't know that we can put a label on the human-animal bond and say it's only for cats, dogs, and horses, because it crosses species. A quick personal example, I adopted a California Desert Tortoise when I was a student, a Veterinary student. And so you can, you know, that was a long time ago and I'd had it. It and I'd estimated it was about 57 years old. I think I had it for about 35 years. So that animal was part of my life for 35 years. Every day for 35 years, I get up, I where I live, I bring them to a bedroom at night and take them out during the day. I feed it, I water it, I clean it. And eventually, it ended up getting liver cancer. So I did the endoscopy on it, I saw it, I took biopsies on it. I just about died. Got the results back, it came back cancer. I didn't want to let him suffer, so I gave him hospice care until he was no longer comfortable, and I had to put him down. I was a mess. An absolute mess. I mean, how do you have something in your life for 35 years and all of a sudden it's not there anymore, you know? And think that it's not going to affect you.

Chinese:
是的，我不知道我们是否可以给人与动物的纽带贴上标签，说它只适用于猫、狗和马，因为它跨越了物种。一个快速的个人例子，当我还是一个兽医学生时，我收养了一只加利福尼亚沙漠乌龟。所以你可以，你知道，那是很久以前的事了，我养了它。我估计它大约57岁。我想我养了它大约35年。所以那只动物是我生活的一部分，35年。每天35年，我起床，我在我居住的地方，我在晚上把它们带到卧室，白天把它们带出来。我喂它，我给它水，我清理它。最终，它得了肝癌。所以我对它做了内窥镜检查，我看到它，我对它做了活检。我几乎要死了。结果回来了，它患上了癌症。我不想让他受苦，所以我给了他临终关怀，直到他不再舒服，我不得不让他安乐死。我是一团糟。一个绝对的烂摊子。我的意思是，你的生活中有什么东西存在了35年，然后突然它就不在了，你知道吗？并且认为这不会影响你。

English:
So, you know, people have dogs and cats for 10, 15, maybe 20 years. That's a long time. Have something for 35 years, and I know people who have. I have clients who have tortoises that have been in their family for over 100 years, documented, passed down from grandfather to father to son. How can you not have a bond or something like that? Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, I think about even my crested gecko. He was hatched in '05, and I bought him in '07. I've had him for an incredible amount of time.

Chinese:
所以，你知道，人们养狗和猫可能有10年，15年，甚至可能20年。那是很长的时间。有些东西有35年，我知道有些人有。我有客户，他们的家族中有乌龟已经有100多年的历史了，这是有文档记载的，从祖父传给父亲，再传给儿子。你怎么可能不会有这样的纽带呢？绝对的。是的，我的意思是，我甚至想到了我的冠状壁虎。他是在05年孵化的，我在07年买的。我养了他很长的时间。

English:
And I was just saying that to my wife the other day. I'm like, "Isn't it crazy for the past basically 15 or 16, 17 years I've fed this animal every couple of days?" It just becomes part of your routine that you don't even realize you're doing it, but you're caring for this animal. It's like, yeah, I go back to being in grade 11, and that's when I got that animal. And now, I have a child of my own and I have a career. It's just, it's crazy how, and that's the special thing about reptiles is so many of them are so long-lived that they come along with your entire journey of your life. Or like you said, a dog might only

Welcome to the "Reptos and Research" podcast. Today's guest is Jennifer Angela Rhodes. She has a Master's degree in animal welfare, ethics, and law. Jennifer provides a highly intellectual conversation. Despite being profoundly intelligent and qualified, she maintains a casual demeanor, which makes for an engaging dynamic. This episode is relaxed and conversational. We delve into ethics and explore areas that challenge people to reflect on their own thoughts and feelings. I genuinely enjoyed this episode. It reshaped some of my own opinions, and I believe many will benefit from it. So, without further ado, let's welcome Jennifer Angela Rhodes. Thank you for joining the podcast, Jennifer. Given your expertise in welfare, we're excited to discuss topics often avoided, which is the essence of this channel. Could you introduce yourself and share your journey into the realm of welfare?

Jennifer: Well, my name is Jennifer. My path into animal welfare started with exotics. I've been involved with the exotics hobby for about 12 years. Over time, I noticed a surge in animal companies that showcase animals and offer animal interactions. I worked for a few and observed a concerning lack of regulation. At that time, the only legislation in place was the Performing Animals Register from 1925, which was outdated. I pursued a career in animal welfare to address these issues, especially those regarding transportation and zoonotic diseases. I completed a three-year bachelor's degree in animal welfare and behavior and graduated with first-class honors. While fulfilling, I wouldn't choose to experience it again. My main focus has always been on exotics. The title "animal welfare consultant" isn't protected, meaning anyone can claim it. Many consultants lack proper qualifications, especially regarding exotics. I wanted to fill that gap, so I did a Master's in Animal Welfare Science, Ethics, and Law. Although it primarily emphasized livestock, it expanded my understanding of various ethical viewpoints, like utilitarianism and speciesism. Since then, I've worked mainly in licensing, helping with various animal activity licenses. I've had success in this domain and also provide expert opinions for local authorities. I collaborate closely with the Animal Welfare Officer in Nuneaton, who isn't as familiar with exotics as I am. This partnership allows me to contribute in various capacities. Being a pet keeper and undergoing that Master's program profoundly impacted my perspectives. The initial phase of my Master's was especially challenging. It made me confront my beliefs and strive for consistency in ethics. Facing uncomfortable truths was part of the process. Many avoid this confrontation, but addressing it leads to personal growth and understanding.

欢迎收听“Reptos与Research”播客。今天的嘉宾是Jennifer Angela Rhodes，她拥有动物福利、伦理和法律的硕士学位。尽管Jennifer学识渊博，她却能保持轻松的态度，为我们带来了一场深入的对话。在本期节目中，我们深入探讨了伦理问题，挑战人们对自己思想和情感的反思。现在，请让我们欢迎Jennifer Angela Rhodes。Jennifer，感谢你加入我们的播客。你在动物福利领域的专长让我们很期待这次的对话。能否简单介绍一下你自己以及你是如何进入动物福利领域的？

Jennifer: 我叫Jennifer。我在动物福利领域的初始兴趣是热带动物。我已经参与这个领域12年了。随着时间的推移，我注意到动物公司的兴起。当时，只有1925年的表演动物登记是有效的，但它已经过时。为了解决这些问题，我选择了动物福利领域。我获得了动物福利和行为学士学位，并获得了一等荣誉。尽管这是一个满足的经历，但我不会再选择这样的经历。我一直主要关注热带动物。我希望成为一个动物福利顾问，所以我决定攻读动物福利科学、伦理和法律硕士学位。虽然这主要强调家畜，但它扩展了我对各种伦理观点的理解。从那时起，我主要在许可领域工作。我也为地方政府提供专家意见。我与Nuneaton的动物福利官员紧密合作。这种合作使我能够以各种方式贡献。作为一个宠物饲养者，硕士课程深深影响了我的观点。硕士课程的初期尤为具有挑战性。它使我面对自己的信仰，并在伦理上追求一致性。面对不舒服的真相是过程的一部分。很多人避免这种对话，但面对它会导致个人成长和理解。

**English Version:**
Aspect and once you've faced them, and you can talk about it and navigate around it, you come to your own conclusion. Many people don't do this. They stick with cognitive dissonance and don't advance to that extra level. Animal ethics is a crucial part of animal welfare. Without animal ethics, you cannot genuinely understand animal welfare. Animal welfare science provides the necessary scientific foundation, while animal ethics offers the philosophy that gives the "why." You must have both the "why" and the "how" to have a complete answer. When diving into this topic, I might lean more towards welfare as that's where my knowledge lies. But before we delve deeper, you mentioned cognitive dissonance. Can we define what that is? Cognitive dissonance, to put it succinctly, occurs when one holds a belief, often based on false premises, that conflicts with observable reality. Everyone has an innate desire to be moral due to our social nature. When faced with the truth that contradicts our beliefs, especially if it indicates our actions may not be moral, we often resist accepting it. This denial can be seen frequently in the world of animal keeping. A prominent example might be the consumption of meat and the ethical considerations surrounding it. Many people choose not to confront the conditions under which animals are raised or the methods of their slaughter. This is a form of cognitive dissonance. Personally, after learning about animal ethics, I find it hard to justify eating meat solely for pleasure. I believe I should be vegetarian, if not vegan. Yet, I'm not because I recognize my own hypocrisy. If I consume animals purely for my enjoyment, I cannot criticize other forms of animal exploitation, like circuses. It would be hypocritical. This is my perspective, and I had to grapple with it during my studies. But once you see the broader picture, it becomes clearer. Can you clarify the difference between animal welfare, animal rights, and ethics? Animal welfare focuses on the physical and mental state of an animal in its living conditions. While there isn't a universally agreed-upon definition, it is multi-faceted, combining various aspects to give a holistic view. In the UK, the legal standard often refers to the five freedoms. I personally prefer the five domains from Mela as a way to assess animal welfare. Then, there's animal ethics, which deals with the philosophical reasons behind our actions, as opposed to the more methodical, measurable approach of science.

**Chinese Version:**
面对这些问题后，您可以讨论并绕过它，得出自己的结论。很多人都不这样做。他们停留在认知失调阶段，不再进一步。动物伦理是动物福利的关键部分。没有动物伦理，您无法真正理解动物福利。动物福利科学为我们提供了必要的科学基础，而动物伦理则提供了哲学，给出了"为什么"。你必须同时具备"为什么"和"怎么做"才能得到完整的答案。在此主题中，我可能更偏向于福利知识。但在我们深入探讨之前，您提到了认知失调。我们能定义它吗？简而言之，认知失调是当某人持有一个信念，往往基于错误的前提，与可观察的现实发生冲突时出现的情况。由于我们的社交本性，每个人都有天生的道德愿望。当面对与我们的信仰相矛盾的真相时，尤其是如果它指示我们的行为可能不道德，我们通常会抵制接受它。在动物饲养的世界中经常可以看到这种否认。消费肉类及其周围的伦理考虑可能是一个典型的例子。许多人选择不面对动物的饲养条件或其屠宰方法。这是认知失调的一种形式。在学习动物伦理后，我发现很难仅为了快乐而吃肉。我认为我应该是素食者，如果不是纯素食者。但我不是，因为我承认自己的伪善。如果我纯粹为了自己的享受而消费动物，我不能批评其他形式的动物剥削，比如马戏团。这是伪善的。这是我的观点，我在学习期间必须与之斗争。但是，一旦您看到更广泛的图片，它变得更加清晰。您能澄清动物福利、动物权利和伦理之间的区别吗？动物福利关注动物在其生活条件下的身体和精神状态。虽然没有普遍认同的定义，但它是多方面的，结合了各种方面以给出一个整体的观点。在英国，法律标准通常提到五大自由。我个人更喜欢Mela的五个领域作为评估动物福利的方式。然后，有动物伦理，它处理我们行动背后的哲学原因，而不是科学的更有方法论的、可测量的方法。

**English Version:**
Part 2:
Then you come to animal ethics, which is the philosophical side of the topic. You delve into the explanations and reasons, rather than the science. While science is methodical and relies on measurable, observable, repeatable data, it doesn't answer the questions like, "Why am I doing this?", "Why is it important?", or "Why should I care?". Science provides the data. Thus, one needs to understand animal ethics to comprehend the science fully. Within animal ethics, various ethical viewpoints exist. Two main ones, especially in the UK, are animal rights and utilitarianism. Others include speciesism and a few more, some of which might appear strange, but everyone has a right to their ethical viewpoint.

Ethics in general concern the societal understanding of right and wrong, while morals reflect individual compasses. In England, our ethical beliefs are rooted in Christianity, affecting our perception of animals. Our understanding originates from biblical teachings where God created animals for man. While many religions have their unique perspectives on animals, in the UK, Christianity remains foundational. As a social species, we have a strong foundation in ethics and morals. If you isolated newborns on an island, provided they survived, they'd establish their system of ethics and morals. These systems emerge from our social nature, which everyone benefits from, although some may deviate and face societal consequences. Morals are shaped by family, experiences, and friends, whereas ethics represent societal consensus.

It's a misinterpretation to use "ethics" and "morals" or "animal welfare" and "animal rights" interchangeably. Animal rights is just a subset of animal ethics. What many term "Animal Welfare" is closer to utilitarianism. In the USA, there's a concept called "new welfarism" derived from animal rights that gradually phases out animal use rather than total abolition. Like various branches of utilitarianism or animal rights, each has subcategories, causing potential confusion. Many assume it's either welfare or rights, but everyone attributes some rights to animals. If someone harms a dog in front of an individual, the person's reaction indicates that they believe the animal has rights.

Utilitarianism and animal rights aren't so distinct. Tom Regan and Peter Singer, pioneers of these fields, were close friends. Singer popularized utilitarianism, while Regan championed animal rights. The concept of utilitarianism traces back further to thinkers like John Mills and Jeremy Bentham. Bentham included a brief segment on animals, questioning not if they can reason or speak but if they can suffer. This sentiment marked the beginning of including animals in broader ethical discussions, though progress was slower without modern communication tools like the internet.

第二部分：
首先是动物伦理学，这是话题的哲学方面。相比之下，科学是方法论的，并依赖于可测量、可观察、可重复的数据，但它不能回答“为什么这么做？”等问题。因此，为了全面理解科学，我们需要理解动物伦理学。在动物伦理学中，存在各种伦理观点，特别是在英国，主要有动物权利和功利主义。其他还包括种族主义和一些其他的，尽管有些可能看起来很奇怪，但每个人都有权持有他们的伦理观点。

一般来说，伦理学涉及社会对正确与错误的理解，而道德反映个人的观念。在英格兰，我们的伦理信仰植根于基督教，影响着我们对动物的看法。作为社会物种，我们在伦理和道德上有坚实的基础。道德是由家庭、经验和朋友形成的，而伦理代表社会共识。

错误地使用“伦理”和“道德”或“动物福利”和“动物权利”是一种误解。动物权利只是动物伦理学的一个子集。功利主义和动物权利并不那么不同。功利主义和动物权利的先驱Tom Regan和Peter Singer是亲近的朋友。功利主义的概念追溯到John Mills和Jeremy Bentham等思想家。Bentham对动物进行了简短的描述，不是问它们是否可以推理或说话，而是问它们是否可以受苦。这种情感标志着在更广泛的伦理讨论中包括动物的开始，尽管在没有现代通信工具如互联网的情况下，进展较慢。

**English Version:**
Part 3. A segment of one of his books introduced the idea of including animals in conversations. However, the Internet didn't exist back then. Discussions spanned hundreds of years and relied on lengthy exchanges of written letters. Imagine needing to articulate an argument and having to wait months for a response. Personally, I couldn't endure such a process; I would crave an immediate answer. Yet, that's how it used to be. And as conversations persisted, they were altered due to misunderstandings or the "Chinese Whispers" effect. It was only around 1975 that we began exploring animal rights and utilitarianism in depth. This concept is relatively recent. Do you believe that animal rights influence our development as reptile keepers? That some actions are taken subconsciously, without individuals even realizing? Absolutely. The foundation of animal rights hinges on certain non-utilitarian principles, or what I refer to as "rights." These are the right to life, the right to liberty, and the right to freedom. These rights are non-negotiable. For instance, in reptile keeping, an animal has the inherent right to life. One shouldn't end its life arbitrarily. Most people understand and respect this instinctively. They wouldn't harm a reptile without cause. This reflects an internal assignment of moral status to the creature. Assigning moral status means recognizing the interests and feelings of another being. For example, not inflicting harm on a dog because we understand it will experience pain, and having felt pain ourselves, we empathize. Historically, animals were regarded as property in legal terms. Harming an animal was seen as damaging someone's property rather than causing the animal pain. However, this changed with the introduction of the Animal Welfare Act of 2006, which assigned moral status to animals. Now, the focus is on preventing harm to the creature rather than to its owner. What are your views on this? I've noticed extreme attitudes in this field. Some are staunchly utilitarian, while others are fervently for animal rights. Indeed, many don't even fit the utilitarian mold. Carl Cohen's writings exemplify this. His work, while commendable in effort, often misses the mark. He promotes a sort of contractual ethic, suggesting we can treat animals however we see fit. This perspective, in my opinion, dominates the hobby. Many seem to believe they have a right to keep an animal without considering its needs, well-being, or mental and physical states. They base their arguments on their rights rather than the animal's moral worth. I've observed that many speak of their pets as mere species rather than individuals with unique needs and personalities. This outlook should shift. The transformation often happens when keepers start seeing their pets as unique entities. They then feel more responsible for their own pets than for others'. However, all animals possess the same rights and moral worth. Personal bias makes us value our own more, but objectively, they all share the same value. Some arguments aim to appeal broadly but often fall short. They might grab attention but inadvertently diminish the value of the animals in question.

**Chinese Version:**
第三部分。其中一个他的书的部分介绍了在对话中包括动物的想法。然而，那时没有互联网。讨论跨越了数百年，依赖于长时间的书面交流。这种沟通方式现在看来非常低效。大约在1975年，我们开始深入探讨动物权利和功利主义。这个观念是相对较新的。您认为动物权利是否影响了我们作为爬行动物饲养者的发展?绝对如此。动物权利的基础取决于某些非功利的原则，或者我称之为"权利"。这些是生命权、自由权和自由权。这些权利是不容妥协的。例如，一个动物有固有的生命权。现在的焦点是防止对生物造成伤害而不是对其所有者。您对此有什么看法？我在这个领域注意到了极端的态度。卡尔·科恩的著作是一个例证。他的工作经常失凖。许多人似乎相信他们有权饲养动物，而不考虑其需求、健康或心理和身体状态。他们的论点基于他们的权利，而不是动物的道德价值。所有动物都拥有相同的权利和道德价值。我们的个人偏见使我们更重视自己的动物，但客观地说，它们都有相同的价值。


**English Version:**  
"Appeal to the masses in that sense, and it's not effective. Well, it's effective in scaremongering, and it's effective in its interesting language, and people pay attention to it. But it completely devalues the life of the animals who are involved in it. So, where did this leave your relationship with your own hobby?"  
"Then, I came out of it. I stopped, but I kept what I had and continued with it. But now, I don't really keep many. I've got some invertebrates and two snakes. Other than that, I have a spider as well. They're usually things that are rescued. I hate the word 'rescue', but it's what somebody doesn't want anymore or dumped at a shop. I can pick it up, and I have those two snakes, that's it."  
"So, you have your pets, but you don't consider yourself an active hobbyist anymore?"  
"Not anymore, no. And that wasn't necessarily because of the animal ethics side. It was more to do with the hobby itself just being exhausting. It ruined the joy. And then, of course, the animal ethics added to the ruin of that joy. All I had left was heartache. But when it comes to welfare, how did you view your own hobby? And then what you could do and how you felt about things?"  
"There's a lot of bad, but there is good. There is some really good, and I'm glad that I know the good. But when you're looking at the problem, you have to look at it outside of the box as an overall problem. And when you talk about the general hobby, not the fantastic setups we see behind us, it's mainly going to be low welfare. Many keep them in racks, don't understand reptile welfare or reptile behavior, or view them as lesser animals. They suffer greatly and for a long time before they actually die. Liam and I had a conversation about this. I work in rescues and with dogs. When dogs are in distress, they show obvious signs. But these emotions are felt the same in reptiles, but they suffer in silence. They're not showing overt distressing behaviors. They are internally screaming."  
"And then there's anthropomorphism. People think reptiles look sad, but they don't have eyebrows. So, how can you say they look sad? The hobby used to be polarized; either you were completely dismissive of their feelings or entirely emotional about their well-being. There was no middle ground."  
"I've been pondering the concept of sentience. For me, I can't find a good definition. Some say sentience is recognizing oneself, while others believe it's just about feeling."  
"Sentience is about experiencing pleasurable and negative feelings. Consciousness is about understanding oneself and one's place in the world. In 2013, a Cambridge study on sentience was conducted. Neuroscientists, including Stephen Hawking, defined sentience. They concluded that all animals up to invertebrates, and including some invertebrates, are sentient. Therefore, we consider all animals to be sentient now. Cephalopods, crustaceans, and certain insects are included. The science focuses on measuring and proving it, while the ethics is about personal belief. I think we should give animals the benefit of the doubt. Absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence."

**Chinese Version:**  
"这种方式吸引大众并不有效。虽然在恐吓方面和语言特点上有效，但它完全贬低了动物的生命价值。那么，这对你的兴趣爱好产生了什么影响？"  
"然后，我放弃了。现在，我只留下了一些无脊椎动物和两条蛇，还有一只蜘蛛。这些大多是被救助的动物。"  
"所以，你不再认为自己是一个活跃的爱好者了吗？"  
"不，我不再是了。这与动物伦理无关，更多的是兴趣爱好本身让我感到疲惫，它消磨了我的快乐。谈到动物福利，你是如何看待自己的兴趣爱好的？"  
"坏的方面很多，但也有好的。但从整体上看，大部分情况下动物的福利很低。许多人不了解爬行动物的福利或行为，认为它们是次等动物。它们遭受的痛苦要长得多。与Liam的对话让我认识到，我在救助站工作，与狗相处。当它们处于困境时，会明显展示出来。但是这些情感在爬行动物中也存在，但它们在静默中受苦。"  
"还有一个问题是拟人论。有些人认为爬行动物看起来很伤心，但它们没有眉毛。过去，这个领域很极端，你要么完全不承认它们的感受，要么完全情感化它们的健康。中间没有立场。"  
"我一直在思考意识的概念。对我来说，找不到一个好的定义。有人说意识是识别自己，而有些人认为它只是关于感觉。"  
"意识是关于体验愉悦和负面的情感。意识是关于理解自己和自己在世界上的位置。2013年，剑桥进行了一个关于意识的研究。神经科学家，包括斯蒂芬·霍金，定义了意识。他们得出的结论是，所有的动物到无脊椎动物，甚至一些无脊椎动物，都是有意识的。因此，我们现在认为所有的动物都是有意识的。科学重点是测量和证明，而伦理是关于个人信仰。我认为我们应该给动物一个怀疑的利益。没有证据并不意味着没有存在。"

**English Version:**
Part 5: 
Giving something the benefit of the doubt is essential. Just because one has not observed wrongdoing, it doesn't mean it hasn't occurred. The absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. Much of animal ethics is intertwined with human ethics. For instance, if a human being cannot communicate verbally or is blind, deaf, and mute, does that mean they don't have rights? We grant them the same rights as we possess because we acknowledge the potential for their experiences, even if we can't directly observe them. Similarly, when I look at you, I can't truly understand your pain or love. However, I can assume you feel them because I do. There's no empirical evidence to suggest otherwise. Our emotions and values are universal. An animal's happiness should be valued just as much as a human's. 

Some may dismiss these thoughts as mere sentimentality. In the world of animal hobbyists, there's a push against anthropomorphism, leading some to attribute purely mechanical characteristics to animals. These people misinterpret balanced perspectives as extreme ones. This is one reason I left that hobby. The reptile segment, especially, seems resistant to the idea of giving creatures the benefit of the doubt, despite ample evidence of reptiles displaying emotions like happiness and affection, especially in species like crocodilians.

Evolutionarily, it would make sense for monogamous species to experience something akin to love as it promotes pair bonding and group cohesion. Whether or not it matches our conception of love is irrelevant. The important thing is to acknowledge these emotions when considering their lives in captivity. While in humans, love is often described as a chemical response in the brain to certain stimuli, the same basic processes might apply to reptiles. However, when you describe this process using terms associated with human emotions, many resist the idea. The objective physiological responses can be observed in both humans and animals, but subjective experiences remain elusive. We can't truly know how another being subjectively feels.

It's challenging to prove many things as factual truths. The world isn't black and white but a spectrum of grey. Establishing something as an absolute truth is extremely difficult. Philosophy brings rationality into play when science can't provide all the answers. While empirical data is vital, we also need rationality and ethics to guide our understanding.

**Chinese Version:**
第五部分：
给予某物的好处是至关重要的。仅因为一个人没有观察到错误行为，并不意味着它没有发生。没有证据并不意味着不存在。动物伦理学与人类伦理学密切相关。例如，一个人如果不能用言语沟通或是盲、聋、哑，那是否意味着他们没有权利？我们应该赋予他们与我们相同的权利，因为我们承认他们可能有的经验，即使我们不能直接观察到。同样地，当我看着你时，我真的无法理解你的痛苦或爱。但我可以假设你也有这些感觉，因为我有。没有实证证据表明反之。我们的情感和价值观是普遍的。动物的幸福应该与人的一样受到重视。

有些人可能认为这些思考过于感性。在动物爱好者的世界里，人们反对拟人化，导致一些人纯粹地将机械特性归因于动物。这些人误解了平衡的观点。这也是我放弃那个爱好的原因之一。特别是在爬行动物领域，人们似乎对给予生物利益的想法持有抵触情感，尽管有大量证据表明爬行动物展示了诸如幸福和亲情之类的情感，尤其是在鳄鱼这类物种中。

从进化的角度来看，对于一夫一妻的物种来说，经历类似于爱的东西是有意义的，因为它促进了配对结合和群体凝聚。无论它是否符合我们对爱的概念都是无关紧要的。重要的是在考虑它们在囚禁中的生活时承认这些情感。尽管在人类中，爱通常被描述为大脑对某些刺激的化学反应，但相同的基本过程可能也适用于爬行动物。然而，当你使用与人类情感相关的术语来描述这一过程时，许多人都抗拒这一观念。在人类和动物中都可以观察到客观的生理反应，但主观体验仍然是难以捉摸的。我们真的不能知道另一个生物主观地感觉。

证明许多事情作为事实真理是具有挑战性的。世界不是非黑即白，而是一个灰色的光谱。确立某事为绝对真理是极其困难的。当科学不能提供所有答案时，哲学为我们提供了理性。虽然实证数据至关重要，但我们还需要理性和伦理来指导我们的理解。

**English Version:**
Part 6: There is very little in this world that can be considered an absolute truth. You'd be surprised what it takes to prove something as true. It's not black and white; it's very gray and multicolored. You can sift through various facets, and your perspective might change when presented with different evidence. But some people aren't open to evidence or scientific reasoning. Their cognitive dissonance prevents them from accepting the possibility that they might be wrong. This is evident when considering certain individuals who are content with minimalistic conditions, almost like they need nothing more than a hole to hide in. I would rather provide them with more than they need, even if it remains unused, than to deprive them of essentials. This issue is especially evident in zoos, where captivity is often mistaken for benevolence. Animals in captivity might seem well-cared-for, with food and comfort readily available. However, their freedom of choice, a crucial aspect of well-being, is stripped away. Even small decisions, like what they want to eat, make a significant difference. Some might argue that captivity is beneficial, but it's not always the paradise it's portrayed to be. Consider an experiment called "The Happiness Thought Machine": If you could live in a room, attached to a machine that ensures constant happiness, would you choose it? While this machine offers endless joy without the need for sustenance, many would decline the offer. Life's trials and tribulations, the good and the bad, and the choices we make, are what truly define living. Similarly, we shouldn't assume animals would opt for a life without challenges. We must remember that humans are animals too, merely a different species. It's essential to define terms like emotion and feeling for clarity. Emotion can be scientifically measured based on chemical reactions in the brain and body. In contrast, feelings are subjective interpretations of these reactions. It's challenging to scientifically measure feelings since they vary among individuals. Pain perception and responses, for instance, differ significantly. A fish might experience pain, but its response might be similar to other stimuli, like fear. Humans, however, have evolved complex languages and communication methods, which has shaped our understanding of intelligence. Often, we gauge intelligence based on our parameters, primarily focusing on language skills. Yet, there's more to intelligence than just language. For example, while I might not care if a crow can paint, it's fascinating to learn that crows understand the concept of zero. Their comprehension, despite having different brain structures from humans, expands our understanding of animal intelligence. This realization challenges conventional notions of animal behavior and welfare, introducing new perspectives. There's been scientific proof of emotions in reptiles for a long time. Studies from the 90s even examined dopamine levels in Royal pythons.

**Chinese Version:**
第六部分：这个世界上几乎没有绝对的真理。你会惊讶于确定某事为真需要什么。事物并非非黑即白，而是复杂多变的。面对不同的证据，我们的观点可能会发生变化。但有些人不接受证据或科学推理。他们的认知失调使他们无法接受自己可能是错的。例如，在动物园中，囚禁常被误认为是仁慈。在囚禁中的动物可能看起来得到了很好的照顾，但他们的选择自由被剥夺了。考虑一个叫做“快乐思考机器”的实验：如果你可以在一个房间里与一个确保持续幸福的机器相连，你会选择它吗?生活的试炼和选择是真正定义生活的东西。因此，我们不应该假设动物会选择没有挑战的生活。我们必须记住，人类也是动物，只是不同的物种。情感可以根据大脑和身体中的化学反应在科学上进行测量。而感觉是这些反应的主观解释。由于感觉在个体之间有所不同，因此很难在科学上测量感觉。人类已经进化出复杂的语言和沟通方法，这已经塑造了我们对智慧的理解。然而，智慧不仅仅是语言。例如，乌鸦了解零的概念是令人着迷的。这一认识扩展了我们对动物智慧的理解。这一发现挑战了动物行为和福利的传统观念，带来了新的视角。长期以来，科学界已经证明爬行动物有情感。90年代的研究甚至检查了皇家蟒蛇的多巴胺水平。

**English Version:**
Part 7
The walls of animal behavior and animal welfare introduce new concepts. It's really cool. The concept of emotions in reptiles has been scientifically proven for quite some time now. I mean, there are papers from the '90s discussing Royal pythons and dopamine, and papers from the '60s on tortoises playing. Play behavior is defined as a behavior without a specific function. It's not about survival, and if it doesn't fall under the category of the "four F's," it's considered play behavior. For example, climbing up a slide, sliding down, and then doing it again. If there's a choice to do other activities and the animal continues with this action, then perhaps that's play behavior. Brains are incredible; they can get bored. To combat this, animals create their own amusement. Sometimes, this results in stereotypical behaviors which we often observe in captivity. Some stereotypical behaviors might not be detrimental; it depends on how they affect the animal. It's a complex topic, isn't it? We might perceive it as negative because witnessing it can make us uncomfortable, but in that moment, the animal might be comforting itself. It's a coping mechanism. You often see this in elephants in small enclosures, rocking back and forth. Bears, too, especially when moved to a larger enclosure without proper adjustment. They might repeat the same actions because it's comforting. So, not all stereotypical behaviors are inherently bad, especially if they don't stem from poor husbandry practices. The perception of these behaviors has evolved. Previously, it was assumed that stereotypical behavior was bad and should be minimized. However, now there's a new understanding that some of these behaviors might be self-soothing. We humans do it too. For instance, if you've ever paced back and forth anxiously at a vet's office while your pet was unwell, that's a type of stereotypical behavior. It serves a purpose. If someone were to stop you from pacing, it might exacerbate your anxiety because your outlet has been restricted. Animals should have choices. Some hobbyists might argue against letting animals out of their designated environments, but giving them the option is crucial. During our call, we let her out, she wandered for a bit and then came back. It's about self-regulation and giving them a paradigm of choice. Although she slips on this floor, I think getting a rug might help. Many in the UK hobbyist community are now allowing their pets more freedom, letting them roam. There are YouTube channels dedicated to this concept. Our friend Lori Turini, for example, lets her ball pythons roam freely. She might not see her python for weeks! When snakes escape and have a designated space to return to, it ensures higher welfare. The debate about enclosure size is almost redundant because you can never fully replicate their natural environment. Offering choices will lead to better welfare. Rather than debating if a snake should be allowed certain movements, the focus should be on their overall well-being. Explaining these concepts to someone outside the reptile hobby might seem complicated.

第七部分
动物行为和动物福利的研究提出了新的观点。长久以来，科学已证明爬行动物具有情感。例如，20世纪90年代关于王家蟒和多巴胺的论文，以及20世纪60年代关于乌龟玩耍的论文。玩耍行为是没有特定功能的行为，不是为了生存。如果这不属于“四F”范畴，那么它就被视为玩耍行为。动物大脑是非常复杂的，它们会感到无聊。有时，这会导致典型的行为。这种行为可能不是有害的，取决于它如何影响动物。这是一个复杂的主题。我们可能认为这是负面的，但在那一刻，动物可能正在自我安慰。例如，你经常可以看到小笼子里的大象来回摇摆。熊也是如此，尤其是在没有适当调整的情况下被移动到更大的笼子中。它们可能会重复相同的动作，因为这是安慰的。因此，并非所有的刻板行为都是固有的不好，尤其是如果它们不是源于糟糕的饲养实践。关于这些行为的看法已经发展了。例如，人类也这样做。动物应该有选择。提供选择是关键。动物应该有自我调节的能力和选择的范式。与此同时，为它们提供更好的环境是很重要的。许多英国的宠物爱好者现在允许他们的宠物更自由地漫游。例如，我们的朋友Lori Turini就让她的球蟒自由漫游。当蛇逃跑并有一个指定的返回空间时，它确保了更高的福利。关于笼子大小的辩论几乎是多余的，因为你永远不能完全复制它们的自然环境。提供选择将导致更好的福利。关注他们的整体幸福感应该是重点。对于爬行动物爱好者以外的人来说，解释这些概念可能似乎很复杂。

**English Version:**
Going to see higher welfare rather than arguing over whether a snake should be able to lift its head off. I think it's difficult because when you take someone out of the reptile hobby and you explain to them, "We are deciding whether or not the minimum length of the snake's habitat should be the same length as the snake itself," they might respond with, "So, the animal can live in a box the same length as itself?" It sounds bad when you put it like that. Even our houses, they're bigger than we are, unless you are really long, I suppose. Normally, houses are much bigger than us. Being confined to a house can be stifling. It all comes down to choice. During the lockdown, I've never felt more confined. I wanted to be outside, not necessarily because I wanted to, but because I was told I couldn't. It was a challenge.

During those two years of lockdown, it was difficult for many. I'm quite reclusive and comfortable with my own company, so the lockdown wasn't much of a struggle for me. I enjoyed the internet, video games, and such. But people are different. I also had moments when I felt trapped. My anxiety worsened, and the constant reminders of the dangers outside amplified my fears. But eventually, my pathological demand avoidance, a part of ADHD, made me resent the confines. I didn't break any rules because I didn't have anyone to visit, but I did find solace in the expensive hobby of gardening. Some argue that if snakes were never kept in captivity, would we choose to keep them? My stance is if I can ensure a high level of welfare, with paradigms of choice and the illusion of choice, then maybe. In the wild, they face threats like parasites, diseases, and predators. Even basic welfare in captivity might be better than facing these dangers in the wild.

Now, let me talk about our sponsor, Custom Reptile Habitats. They are producers of premium PVC enclosures in the US. We use their products and they prioritize animal welfare. We often converse with them about improving reptile habitats. They are committed to enhancing the standards of reptile care. To know more about them, check the link in the description.

Discussing whether captivity is justifiable is a complex matter. In the wild, animals face threats like parasites and predators. But in captivity, we can control these threats. Some argue that certain stressors, like introducing sounds or objects that trigger natural reactions in animals, can be beneficial as they allow the animals to exhibit their natural behaviors. However, we shouldn't introduce threats like diseases. The debate revolves around whether the benefits of captivity outweigh the negatives. Utilitarianism might argue that the greater good is served by captivity, but it's a contentious point.

探讨更高的动物福利，而不是争论蛇是否应该能抬起头。当你把某人从爬行动物爱好者中带出来，向他们解释蛇的栖息地的最小长度是否应该与蛇的长度相同时，听起来很不合理。尽管我们的房子比我们大，但被困在房子里仍然会令人感到压抑。封锁期间，这种压抑感更加强烈。

在那两年的封锁期间，人们感到很难受。我喜欢独处，所以封锁对我来说不算太大问题。但是，我也有焦虑症，外部环境的威胁加剧了我的恐惧。但最终，我对封锁产生了反感，我开始从园艺中寻找慰藉。关于是否应该饲养蛇的争论持续不断。如果我能确保提供高水平的福利，也许在特定条件下的圈养比野外更为合适。

现在，让我介绍我们的赞助商Custom Reptile Habitats。他们在美国生产高质量的PVC动物围栏。我们使用他们的产品，他们非常重视动物福利。要了解更多关于他们的信息，请查看描述链接。

关于圈养是否合理的问题很复杂。在野外，动物面临很多威胁。但在圈养环境中，我们可以控制这些威胁。有人认为，某些刺激，如引入能触发动物自然反应的声音或物体，是有益的。但我们不应引入疾病等威胁。这个争论的核心是圈养的好处是否超过了其负面影响。从功利主义的角度看，圈养可能是合理的，但这是一个有争议的观点。

Part 9:

From my viewpoint, I often question if I'm leaning towards utilitarianism to justify captivity. Does it really serve a utilitarian purpose? Personally, I don't think the consequences outweigh the benefits. When you consider utilitarianism, you're evaluating the greater population, not just individuals. So, in this framework, what are the actual benefits of keeping animals in captivity? Many argue fervently that these captive animals are like a protective collection, awaiting release back into the wild, which supposedly justifies the captivity. However, I don't believe this justification holds water. There have been instances, for example, of snails or oryx being reintroduced. We can also mention the David's deer, which was discovered from an ancient herd once maintained by emperors for hunting. These herds then served as a foundation for the population's resurgence. But, have these reintroduced species become a key, integral part of their environment? Or, could another species have filled that niche? Take the oryx, for instance; they remain in a managed environment. We haven't truly fixed their situation; we are still deeply involved. Rapid environmental changes have also rendered certain habitats unsuitable for certain species. When people discuss resurrecting extinct species, it begs the question: Resurrected to what environment? Their original niche has been filled by another species. The comparison between animals we keep in captivity versus those released is quite disproportionate. The number released is minuscule. The conservation perspective is contentious. I'm neutral about zoos, but many of their arguments, I find, are steeped in cognitive dissonance. The actual good they claim to do seems marginal. What's their real purpose? If it's conservation, then why aren't they making more tangible efforts to reintroduce these animals to the wild or revamp their original habitats? And when it comes to animals' choices, consider this: If a dog returns to you after being let go, is it truly by choice or conditioning? It's largely the latter. Dogs have been domesticated and conditioned for around 140,000 years. Therefore, using them as a yardstick might be unfair. If a snake returns to its enclosure, it might be out of necessity, such as seeking warmth, rather than preference. How do we truly discern an animal's choice?

第9部分：

从我的观点来看，我经常质疑自己是否倾向于功利主义来为囚禁辩护。真的符合功利主义的目的吗？我个人认为后果并不超过好处。当你考虑功利主义时，你正在评估更大的群体，而不仅仅是个体。那么，在这个框架中，囚禁动物的实际好处是什么？许多人激烈地争辩说，这些被囚禁的动物就像一个保护集合，等待被释放回野外，这据称可以为囚禁辩护。但是，我不相信这种辩护是有水平的。例如，已经有蜗牛或犄角羚被重新引入的实例。我们还可以提到大卫鹿，它是从一个古老的鹿群中发现的，这个鹿群曾经是皇帝为了狩猎而维护的。这些鹿群随后为种群的复苏提供了基础。但是，这些被重新引入的物种是否已经成为它们环境的关键、不可或缺的部分？或者，另一个物种能否填补这个生态位？拿犄角羚来说，它们仍然处于受管理的环境中。我们还没有真正解决它们的情况；我们仍然深深地参与其中。快速的环境变化也使某些栖息地不适合某些物种。当人们讨论复活灭绝的物种时，它引发了一个问题：复活到什么环境？他们原来的生态位已经被另一种物种填补了。我们在动物园里养的动物与被释放的动物之间的比较是相当不成比例的。被释放的数量是微不足道的。从保护的角度来看，这是有争议的。我对动物园持中立态度，但我发现他们的许多论点都深深植根于认知失调之中。他们声称的实际好处似乎是边缘的。他们的真正目的是什么？如果是保护，那么为什么他们不做出更多实际的努力将这些动物重新引入到野外或翻新他们的原始栖息地？至于动物的选择，考虑一下：如果一只狗在被放走后回到你身边，那是真的出于选择还是条件反射？这主要是后者。狗已经被驯化和条件反射了大约140,000年。因此，使用它们作为标尺可能是不公平的。如果蛇返回到其饲养箱，那可能是出于必要，例如寻求温暖，而不是偏好。我们如何真正辨别动物的选择？

**English Version:**  
Part 10:  
The people recognize you and associate you with food and good things that are happening to them. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a choice. It means that they have to, to survive. How would you ever know what a choice is unless you've got just the basic choices of food or something different? To get to the very nitty-gritty of it, you'll never really know. Because you can then argue that any choice we make is because we're conditioned to get something out of it that we value. A choice you make to be with someone is because of the value they provide in being with them. So, any choice that we ever make is purely hedonistic. It's what it does to benefit us. Any choice that we ever make is to make ourselves happy. There is no such thing as a selfless act because you're doing it for your own benefit at the end of the day. Giving away a kidney makes you feel good because you've given someone a kidney. We are a social species; we are supposed to get rewards from living like that, from choosing to be moral and good. But we can't say that just because no choice is really ever a choice, that should be taken away. Do you know what I mean?  
Yeah, it's like I do consent-based handling, and I train my pets to come out and have health checks and things like that without me forcing it. But I'm not under any illusion that the reason they do it is because there's food involved. So, is it really a choice or are they like, "I want food, so I have to participate in this to get something out of it?"  
Absolutely, it's the same with all learning and conditioning. It's the illusion of choice. We're not actually making a real choice, which is why you should never, when training animals, offer a main meal as a source of reward for doing something, because that's completely immoral. Treats, yes, but not a main meal of food. I don't do any training with my dog for a main meal. She has her food, she knows she'll get it, and then treats for training after are perfectly fine. But I'd never make it difficult for her to access a main meal. Stupid dog! She's great, really. It's like we're talking now, like our own individual moral compasses at work. We're trying to understand what we all feel individually. Society is very utilitarian, and it justifies things. Then the ethics come in, like you can't ethically say you can't keep pets if you're going to eat meat. I can't say you can't keep pets because I take away the main right of an animal just for my pleasure because I like the taste of meat. So I can't tell someone what's wrong for them to do, but I can try and argue the point to get them to change their mind and improve. Being like that has opened my mind more to new areas than ever before. I've got friends who were in the circus industry, who had a lot of circus animals, including big cats. When you mention "circus" to anyone, it brings an immediate negative response. There were bad things that happened in circuses, but there was also some good. Positive conditioning happened in many circuses. Most zoos are based on circuses; they started off as circuses. You learn a lot more being open to everyone than being shut off. It's better to try and understand where they're coming from. You'll see similarities and differences. You're not going to agree with all of it, and there are things that you can say, "This is too much for me." But to completely cut it off at the beginning is a shame. History will repeat itself if that keeps happening. What I find interesting is that people will condemn one thing but be okay with a similar thing. If you tell most people about performing animal circuses, they think negatively. But if you talk about animal handling experiences, people think it's great.

**Chinese Version:**  
Part 10:  
人们认识你，并将你与食物和他们正在经历的好事物联系起来。但这并不意味着这是一个选择，而是他们为了生存必须这样做。除非你只有基本的食物选择，否则你永远不会知道什么是选择。我们所做的任何选择都是为了从中获得我们所珍视的东西。所以，我们所做的任何选择都是出于利己的目的。每一个选择都是为了使我们自己快乐。真正的无私行为并不存在，因为你最终都是为了自己的利益而行动。我们是社会性的物种，选择做好事、做道德的事应该得到回报。但我们不能因为没有真正的选择就剥夺选择。你明白我的意思吗？  
是的，就像我进行基于同意的处理，我训练我的宠物进行健康检查，而不是强迫它们。但我清楚地知道，它们之所以这样做，是因为有食物作为奖励。所以，这真的是一个选择吗？  
确实，这与所有的学习和条件反射相同。这是选择的幻觉。训练动物时，你绝不能以主食作为奖励。我不会以主食来训练我的狗，她有她的食物，她知道她会得到它，然后是训练后的奖励。但我永远不会让她难以获得主食。我们现在的讨论就像我们各自的道德指南针在工作，我们试图理解我们各自的感受。社会是功利的，它为行为辩护。然后是伦理，例如，你不能说不能养宠物而去吃肉。因此，我不能告诉别人他们做错了什么，但我可以努力说服他们改变他们的观点和行为。这种思维方式使我更加开放，了解新的领域。我有一些朋友曾经在马戏团工作，他们养了很多马戏团动物，包括大猫。提到"马戏团"给人们的第一印象是负面的。马戏团确实发生了一些

Part 11
But they're okay with a very similar thing. So, like you're saying, you tell most people about performing animal circuses and people react negatively. Yet, you mention animal handling experiences and people react positively. That was a part of my dissertation for my Masters. I chose to email every council in England and inquire about the number of animal activities licenses for performing animals they had, as well as the species involved. It turned out there were close to 65,000 exotic species for animal encounters. Now, when circuses were banned, there were a total of 42 exotic animals in circuses that were prohibited. However, we've got 65,000 of them roaming around the UK at any given time. It's deemed acceptable for people to approach and touch these animals, but walking a horse around a stadium without allowing people to touch it is seen as cruel. Moreover, there's no clear definition of what constitutes a "circus". One issue I've observed in the hobby is that people often confuse their opinions with facts. Instead of accepting differing viewpoints, they outright say, "You're wrong." An opinion is purely a matter of preference and can't be refuted. For instance, preferring coffee over tea is an opinion and is immune to challenge. But when someone asserts a belief as a fact, such as "animals can feel pain", that's a statement that can be debated. Similarly, saying "I don't think you should keep that animal for such reasons" is also a statement and not an opinion. Expressing a preference for leopard geckos over bearded dragons is an opinion, but declaring leopard geckos as better pets is a statement that can be debated. The key is distinguishing between the two. An opinion is purely preference. Many people mistakenly claim statements as opinions, believing this shields them from criticism. I've been pondering the distinction between statements and opinions, and it's vital to clarify this to facilitate constructive conversations. Dismissing someone's viewpoint immediately hinders productive dialogue. Merely presenting facts rarely changes one's mind. Philosophical reasoning might offer a better approach, allowing individuals to experience cognitive dissonance and incorporate new information without feeling pressured to immediately change their beliefs. People instinctively become defensive when blamed or criticized. Instead of attacking differing opinions, it's more effective to understand that people simply think differently. However, when discussing the rights of sentient beings, we cannot solely rely on opinions.

但是，他们对类似的事情感到满意。例如，您提及动物表演马戏团，大多数人的反应都是消极的。但是，当您谈论动物处理经验时，人们的反应是积极的。这是我硕士论文的一部分。我选择向英国的每个议会发邮件，询问他们持有多少允许动物表演的动物活动许可证，以及涉及的物种。结果发现有近65,000种异国情调的动物供人们体验。而当马戏团被禁止时，有42种被禁止的马戏团异国情调动物。但我们在任何给定时间都有65,000种这样的动物在英国漫游。人们可以接触和触摸这些动物，这被视为可接受的，但在体育场周围走马而不允许人们触摸它被视为残酷。此外，“马戏团”没有明确的定义。我在业余爱好中观察到的一个问题是，人们经常混淆自己的观点和事实。他们不是接受不同的观点，而是直接说：“你错了。”意见纯粹是一种喜好，不能被反驳。例如，更喜欢咖啡而不是茶是一种观点，不能受到挑战。但是，当有人断言某个信仰是事实，例如“动物能感受痛苦”，那就是一个可以辩论的声明。类似地，说“我不认为你应该因某种原因饲养那种动物”也是一个声明，而不是观点。声明和意见之间的关键是区分。意见纯粹是偏好。许多人错误地声称声明为观点，认为这可以保护他们免受批评。我一直在思考声明和意见之间的区别，为促进建设性的对话，澄清这一点是至关重要的。立即驳回某人的观点会妨碍生产力对话。仅仅提供事实很少能改变一个人的想法。哲学推理可能提供了一种更好的方法，使个体在不感受压力的情况下经历认知失调并吸收新信息。当人们受到责备或批评时，他们本能地变得防御性。与其攻击不同的意见，不如更有效地理解人们只是想法不同。然而，当讨论有情感的生物的权利时，我们不能仅仅依赖于观点。

Part 12:
"Yeah, but when it comes to the rights of other sentient creatures, we can't rely on opinions. Here's a question for you: when someone says there should be no wild-caught animals, and another responds that they think it's justifiable, can you really criticize that person for their opinion? This is where I often find myself confused. It's not just an opinion—it's a statement. If someone says they don't find it justifiable, they must have reasoning behind that. One can then argue if that reasoning is correct or not. Facts are hard to prove in philosophy, but we can always find new ways of thinking. While we are all philosophical to some degree, not all of us are experts. Still, many of us discuss these matters without fully understanding the definitions. Has knowing the definitions helped you navigate these topics, or do you find yourself in turmoil? Without a universally accepted definition, it's hard to come to a conclusion, especially in legal matters. When it comes to laws, I'd like to hear your thoughts on 'positive lists.' Many argue about not impeding individuals, especially when society engages in practices like eating meat. How does this all tie together? Positive lists aim to be scientific, but their degree of accuracy can vary. For instance, some lists discourage keeping king snakes but allow hamsters. Yet, one could argue that a king snake's needs are easier to meet than a nocturnal hamster's, especially in commonly sold plastic cages. Is this an animal rights issue or a scientific one? Some species don't fare well in captivity, like certain snakes that only eat live geckos. They were imported with health issues and refused any food except live geckos. We can't justify breeding and killing one species to feed another when the truth is that particular animal shouldn't be in captivity. Positive lists can be beneficial in such cases. If a species struggles in captivity, perhaps we shouldn't attempt to keep them. Just because one person successfully keeps a difficult species doesn't mean it's okay overall. We should look at the broader impact. The utilitarian approach considers the whole picture, not just individual successes. In these situations, neither animal rights nor utilitarian views would justify such actions. Laws should reflect these conclusions."

第12部分:
"但当涉及其他有感知的生物的权利时，我们不能仅依赖意见。我有个问题：当有人说不应该捕捉野生动物，而另一个人回应说他们认为这是合理的，我们真的可以因为他们的意见批评他们吗？这常使我困惑。这不仅仅是一个意见，而是一个声明。如果某人说他们不认为这是合理的，他们必须有理由。然后我们可以讨论这个理由是否正确。在哲学中，事实很难证明，但我们总能找到新的思考方式。我们都在某种程度上具有哲学性，但并不都是专家。但许多人在不完全理解定义的情冡下讨论这些问题。了解定义是否帮助您探讨这些话题？如果没有普遍接受的定义，尤其在法律问题上很难得出结论。说到法律，我想听听您对'正面清单'的看法。许多人辩论说不应阻止个人，尤其是当社会参与如吃肉这样的实践时。这一切如何联系在一起？正面清单的目标是科学的，但其准确度可能会有所不同。例如，有些清单不鼓励养殖王蛇，但允许仓鼠。然而，有人可能会争辩说，王蛇的需求比夜行性仓鼠更容易满足，尤其是在常卖的塑料笼子中。这是一个动物权利问题还是一个科学问题？有些物种在囚禁中不太适应，如某些只吃活壁虎的蛇。它们带有健康问题的进口，并且除了活壁虎外，不吃任何食物。我们不能为了给一个种类提供食物而辩解繁殖和杀死另一个种类，特别是当真相是该动物不应被囚禁时。正面清单在这种情况下可能是有益的。如果一个物种在囚禁中挣扎，也许我们不应该尝试养它。仅因为一个人成功地养了一个困难的种类并不意味着总体上是可以的。我们应该看看更广泛的影响。功利主义方法考虑整体，而不仅仅是个别的成功。在这些情况下，动物权利和功利观点都不会证明这样的行动。法律应反映这些结论。"

"Yeah, but then when it comes to the rights of other things or the sentient creatures, we can't rely on opinions. Perhaps here's a question for you. So when someone says, 'Oh there should be no wild caught,' and someone says, 'Well I think that is justifiable,' and then someone says you're being naive for saying there's no, that you don't think it should be wild caught, can you really say that to someone? If it's like, God, this is where I trip myself up in my understanding. Force through I think, yeah, it's not an opinion, that's a statement. So when if somebody says, 'I don't find it justifiable,' that means that they have a justification behind that. So they have to put that argument forward and you can either prove that argument right or wrong, you see what I mean? This a fact is very hard to prove in philosophy, very, very hard to prove. So you're not gonna completely get there, but you can find new ways of thinking. When doing there, we're not, you know, when we're all slightly philosophical, we have to be as a species, but we're not all completely PhDs in it so we don't have to get to the conclusion on everything. It doesn't have to work like that, but it does help massively I think. A lot of us act out these things without knowing, without even realizing we, or even know what the definitions of these things are. We're naturally like, 'Why you justify that?' or naturally went, 'Now it's just someone's got an opinion.' Like people go through those motions without knowing what all the definite boundaries, what all the definitions are. I don't know, do you find it's helped you know all the definitions and then helped you navigate that or do you think you've just been like in turmoil half and half term? I mean I'm internal most of the times, but it's difficult without a definition, without a solid definition that everybody plays off it's difficult, but it also helps for it to be more fluid and especially in law, that's important. So basically you're either way, so you just try your best. Some people can get definitions wrong, that's not helpful in general. That's when you can kind of try and not change their mind but show them a different way again. Because if you don't have an automatic definition that everybody agrees on, it's really hard to prove it. So when it comes to law and stuff, let's go into, I would like to ask you opinion on positive lists, are... Okay, so I'd like to ask your opinion and I was also thinking of like when it comes to law and how this all plays into it and people are very much like, 'You can't impede people and you can't tell people what to do,' especially when society is eating meat, like how does this all play, how does this all work? Whoa, the thing about finger positive list is they do try and be scientific, but it's difficult to what degree. So the positive lists that we've had in the past or ones that are definitely have been put forward to the European Council, you know, they don't want people keeping King's legs but hamsters are fine to keep as well. I mean, you could probably do a better job of providing for a king snake, a smaller space is a snake, you've got more space, adequate dietary needs and things than a hamster that's nocturnal and given the plastic cages, it's got nowhere to dig, it completely ignores everything that a hamster is. Why is it that more suitable than the exotic, the snake? And that's when you can pick a part of, 'Is this animal rights based on you cheeky little devils trying to get rid of certain species or is it based on science?' So between the King Snake and say the Welles, the ones that only eat morning geckos live, morning geckos, they don't do very well in captivity and they look like angry shoelaces, do those kind of snakes, absolutely noodles. Obviously all wild caught because they didn't bring captivity, they were all brought in, they were full of parasites and all, they wouldn't eat fresh killed or frozen, they had to eat live geckos. So they justified this using this life-eating method because otherwise the animal wouldn't eat, when really it was, well that animal's not suitable for captivity then is it? So you can't justify breeding and killing one animal to feed another when the truth is just simply don't keep that species in captivity. So that's where positive lists come in handy for stopping that and there are species that just don't do very well in captivity and that is fine, not everything is and we shouldn't necessarily, you know, we tried, we've tried, we've failed, we've tried, we've failed, okay let's go try something different, you know a different species, is there a cousin of that, we don't have to have these bloody angry shoelace snakes in captivity that are just completely unsuitable. I don't think that the ends justify the means of because one person can keep one successfully for so many months, it doesn't justify the thousands that have died to get that one because there's no point of it being in captivity at all. So the utilitarian approach is like over the whole of how many, not just that one person can do it, okay you have to look at the big picture, as it's looking down on it as a whole, not just as a general keeper thing, it's the point of keeping it in captivity, is there a point, if there's not then the end cannot be justifiable, neither animal rights or utilitarian would justify that. Basically, yeah, no they wouldn't. That's where we can come to conclusions and write laws then, because there's no either end could justify it, animal yeah, we ah, our laws are a more, there more potentially based."

第13部分

"是的，但是当涉及到其他事物或有知觉的生物的权利时，我们不能依赖观点。或许我有个问题要问你。所以当有人说，'哦，不应该有野生捕获的，'然后有人说，'我认为那是可以理解的，'然后有人说你因为说没有，你不认为应该野生捕获而天真，你真的可以对某人这么说吗？如果是像，天啊，这是我在理解中让自己困扰的地方。我想我强迫自己，是的，这不是一个观点，这是一个陈述。所以如果有人说，'我不认为这是可以理解的，'那就意味着他们有一个理由在背后。所以他们必须提出那个论点，你可以证明那个论点是对还是错，你知道我在说什么吗？在哲学中，事实是很难证明的，非常、非常难证明。所以你不会完全得到答案，但你可以找到新的思考方式。当我们所有人都有些哲学思考时，我们必须作为一个物种，但我们并非所有人都完全是哲学博士，所以我们不必得出所有事情的结论。事情不必如此，但我认为这确实大有帮助。我们中的很多人在不知不觉中，甚至没有意识到我们，甚至不知道这些事情的定义是什么。我们自然而然地会说，'你为什么证明那个？'或者自然地会说，'现在只是有人有个观点。'就像人们在不知道所有明确的界限，所有的定义是什么的情况下经历那些动作。我不知道，你觉得了解所有的定义并帮助你导航，或者你认为你一直在纠结中吗？我大部分时间都在纠结，但在没有定义，没有大家都接受的坚实定义的情况下，事情很困难，但它也有助于事情更流畅，特别是在法律上，这很重要。所以基本上你是两面，所以你只是尽力而为。有些人可能会理解错定义，总的来说，这不是有帮助的。那时你可以尝试并不是改变他们的想法，而是再次向他们展示一种不同的方式。因为如果你没有一个大家都同意的自动定义，证明它真的很难。所以当涉及到法律和其他事情时，让我们进入，我想问你对积极列表的看法，是...好的，所以我想问你的看法，我也在想当涉及到法律和这一切如何融入其中，人们非常像，'你不能妨碍人们，你不能告诉人们该做什么，'特别是当社会在吃肉的时候，这一切如何运作，这一切如何运作？哇，关于积极列表的事情是，他们确实试图科学化，但是在何种程度上科学化是困难的。所以我们过去有的积极列表，或者那些肯定已经提交给欧洲理事会的列表，你知道，他们不希望人们保持国王的腿，但是养仓鼠是可以的。我的意思是，你可能可以更好地为国王蛇提供，一个较小的空间是一条蛇，你有更多的空间，适当的饮食需求和其他东西，比一个夜行的仓鼠和给予塑料笼子，它无处挖掘，它完全忽视了一个仓鼠是什么。为什么它比异国的，蛇更适合呢？这时你可以挑选一部分，'这是基于你们这些淘气的小恶魔试图摆脱某些物种的动物权利，还是基于科学？'所以在国王蛇和比如说Welles之间，那些只吃早晨壁虎的，生活中的壁虎，他们在圈养中表现不好，他们看起来像愤怒的鞋带，那些蛇，绝对是面条。显然都是野生捕获的，因为他们没有带来圈养，他们都带来了，他们全都是寄生虫，他们不会吃新鲜杀死的或冷冻的，他们必须吃活壁虎。所以他们用这种生活吃的方法来证明这一点，因为否则动物不会吃，当真正的情况是，那个动物不适合圈养，对吧？所以你不能证明繁殖和杀死一种动物来喂另一种动物，当真相只是简单地不在圈养中保持那个物种。所以这就是积极列表对于阻止这一点有用的地方，有些物种在圈养中表现不好，那是可以的，不是所有的事物都是，我们不必一定，你知道，我们试过，我们试过，我们失败了，我们试过，我们失败了，好吧，让我们试试不同的东西，你知道一种不同的物种，有没有那个的表亲，我们不必在圈养中有这些血腥的愤怒的鞋带蛇，它们完全不适合。我不认为因为一个人可以成功地养一只几个月，就能证明为了得到那一只而死去的成千上万只的意义，因为它在圈养中没有任何意义。所以功利主义的方法就像是在整个过程中，不仅仅是一个人可以做到，好吧，你必须看大局，就像是从整体上看下去，而不仅仅是作为一个一般的饲养者的事情，保持它在圈养中的重点，有没有重点，如果没有，那么结局就不能被证明是合理的，动物权利或功利主义都不会证明那个。基本上，是的，不，他们不会。那就是我们可以得出结论并制定法律的地方，因为没有任何一方能证明它，动物，是的，我们啊，我们的法律更多，它们更可能是基于。"

"Neither animal rights nor utilitarianism can justify that," I said. "That's where we can come to conclusions and write laws, because neither end can justify it." Our laws are potentially based more on utilitarianism. They are supposed to be, but they are also based more on individual consequences. That's difficult to explain, and I can't think of the words. They are supposed to be based on utilitarianism but can't all be because that negates utilitarianism. For example, if there are five people who need an organ transplant, and they were all good people, but there was one person who was a bum and had no job, he was just a bad person in general. According to utilitarianism, it's ethically fine to kill that person, take his organs, and give them to the good people. The end justifies the means. One person died to save five, so you can justify a lot of murder with utilitarianism. That's why it had to change a bit to preference utilitarianism, where you couldn't do that. You can't override the basic human interests, values, interests, and rights. In my opinion, the words are interchangeable. My right to life does not negate your right to life. I can't kill you to give me organs if I needed them, don't worry. If it did, that's why the law is slightly different. In animal keeping, it's just utilitarianism. Justify consequences for the end.

"无论是动物权利还是功利主义，都不能为此辩护，"我说。"这就是我们能得出结论并制定法律的地方，因为两者都不能为此辩护。"我们的法律可能更多地基于功利主义。他们应该是，但他们也更多地基于个人后果。这很难解释，我无法找到合适的词语。他们应该基于功利主义，但不能全部都是，因为那会否定功利主义。例如，如果有五个人需要器官移植，他们都是好人，但是有一个人是个流浪汉，没有工作，他总的来说就是个坏人。根据功利主义，杀死那个人，取走他的器官，给那些好人是完全符合伦理的。目的就是手段。一个人死了以救五个人，所以你可以用功利主义为很多谋杀辩护。这就是为什么它必须稍微改变一下变成偏好功利主义，你不能这样做。你不能忽视基本的人类利益、价值、利益和权利。在我看来，这些词是可以互换的。我的生命权并不否定你的生命权。如果我需要，我不能杀你来给我器官，别担心。如果真的这样，那就说明法律有点不同。在动物饲养中，它只是功利主义。为了最后的结果辩护后果。

This sounds like you're very much like me. I could see that you've gone down the rabbit hole because I've gone down the rabbit hole. Like lighting and physics and the electromagnetic spectrum of light and stuff. But when it comes to explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about it, it's like hell. Where do I start? And I can see that. Plus, I have ADHD so it's like it was never meant to make sense. I had no chance from the beginning. But I've gone down the rabbit hole and I did go down the rabbit hole completely. To be able to understand it, it is more of a feeling. You just get it one day and go, "Ah, yeah, that makes sense," rather than all these journal articles explaining to you. 

这听起来你和我很像。我能看出你已经深入其中，因为我也深入其中。像照明和物理以及光的电磁谱等等。但是当要向不懂这些的人解释时，那简直是地狱。我从哪里开始呢？我能看出来。再加上，我有注意力缺陷过动症，所以它似乎永远都没有意义。我从一开始就没有机会。但是我已经深入其中，并且我完全深入其中。要理解它，更多的是一种感觉。有一天你就会突然明白，然后说："啊，是的，那有道理，"而不是所有这些期刊文章向你解释。

There's the structure and measuring side of things, and there's also the ethical side of it. For instance, you could say, "Well, this paper describes that UV has a big role in corn snakes." That's the scientific fact. Morally, some people might say, "Well, I don't care." And it's about making people care. Whatever you say, people just brush it off. How do you explain to somebody why they should care? Why does it affect me? Why should I give my snake UV? The only reason there is animal welfare is because the overwhelming majority of people care about what happens to the animals. And that is based really on animal rights. Every keeper affords some level of animal rights.

事情有结构和测量的一面，也有道德的一面。例如，你可以说："嗯，这篇论文描述了紫外线在玉米蛇中的重要作用。"那是科学事实。在道德上，有些人可能会说："嗯，我不在乎。"而这就是让人们关心的问题。无论你说什么，人们都会不以为然。你如何向某人解释他们为什么应该关心呢？这为什么会影响我？我为什么要给我的蛇提供紫外线？动物福利的唯一原因是绝大多数人关心动物的遭遇。这实际上是基于动物权利的。每个饲养者都提供一定程度的动物权利。

Now, consider this scenario. Peter Singer, a utilitarianism philosopher, proposed a morally controversial situation. He said there's a brother and a sister, both consenting adults, who decide to have a bit of fun together. They are both on birth control so there will be no resulting child, no genetic issues, or anything like that. It would just be the two of them purely having fun together. Is that morally right or wrong? Most people say it's wrong, and when you ask them to explain why, they struggle to articulate it. The whole point is that brother and sister relationships are frowned upon because of potential genetic issues in offspring. But if that's not going to happen, is it still wrong? People say it's wrong because it makes them uncomfortable. It's their moral compass. So even though you've been presented with scientific evidence and facts and information, you've still gone with your moral compass rather than the science. 

现在，考虑这样一个情况。功利主义哲学家彼得·辛格提出了一个道德上有争议的情境。他说有一个兄弟和一个姐姐，都是同意的成年人，他们决定一起玩玩。他们都在避孕，所以不会有孩子，不会有遗传问题，或者类似的事情。这只是他们两个人纯粹一起玩耍。这在道德上是对还是错？大多数人说这是错的，当你让他们解释为什么时，他们很难清楚地表达出来。整个问题是，兄弟姐妹的关系因为后代可能存在的遗传问题而被人们所不齿。但是，如果这不会发生，那还错吗？人们说这是错的，因为这让他们感到不舒服。这是他们的道德罗盘。所以，即使你已经被科学证据、事实和信息所说服，你仍然会选择你的道德罗盘，而不是科学。

Part 15
When there are no consequences to a certain action of incest, there are no consequences to it. They're not going to fall out over it. There is no consequence to this act whatsoever. It's not morally wrong, it can't be because there are no consequences. But we still feel that it's wrong. That feeling overrides any logic or reasoning because the reasoning is there that nothing will happen, it's absolutely fine. But we still feel it's wrong. Even saying it out loud makes me feel sick. I don't even hug my brother. But do you see what I mean? I love conversations like this because they engage a different level of conversation and make you think and question. 

Chinese Version:
第15部分
当某种行为如乱伦没有任何后果时，人们并不会因此而争吵。这个行为本身没有任何后果。它并不是道德上的错误，因为没有任何后果。但我们仍然感觉这是错误的。这种感觉压倒了任何逻辑或推理，因为推理告诉我们没有什么会发生，一切都完全正常。但我们仍然认为这是错误的。甚至大声说出来都让我感到恶心。我甚至都不拥抱我的兄弟。但你明白我的意思吗？我喜欢这样的对话，因为它们引发了不同层次的对话，让你思考和质疑。

English Version:
I want to delve into the positives for you because I could probably guess what your opinions would be, but I want to challenge you. When I ask you what you think the negatives to a positive list would be, well, the issue of homes going underground is a big one. A lot of these spaces are already well established in the community. Another one, to me, is just stupid. There's no real reasoning, no logical or scientific explanation why a California king snake would be banned but a corn snake wouldn't. It makes no sense to me.

Chinese Version:
我想为你探讨一下积极的方面，因为我可能可以猜到你的观点，但我想挑战你。当我问你认为积极名单的负面是什么时，好吧，家庭进入地下的问题是一个大问题。这些空间在社区中已经得到了很好的建立。另一个对我来说就是愚蠢。没有真正的推理，没有逻辑或科学的解释为什么加利福尼亚王蛇会被禁止但是玉米蛇不会。这对我来说没有任何意义。

English Version:
I can understand them putting large reticulated pythons on the list. I can understand when the size of an animal is going to far outweigh any kind of enclosure that you can build for it. In general, because there are people who do build big enough enclosures. And then anything like the dangerous things are on the Dangerous Wild Animals Act. But it's difficult to come up with a really good positive list without it basically being a ban. That's how it's come through. But how can you control large pythons? They're everywhere. You're not going to buy them, you're not going to get rid of them. All it does is just stop people from caring even more about them. It raises the price up even more which means they'll be bred more. You're doing the opposite of what the positive list is supposed to help with, which is the welfare of the animal of that particular species.

Chinese Version:
我可以理解他们把大网蟒放在名单上。我可以理解当动物的大小远远超过你可以为它建造的任何类型的围栏时。总的来说，因为有人确实建造了足够大的围栏。然后像危险的东西都在危险野生动物法案上。但是很难提出一个真正好的积极名单，而不是基本上就是禁令。这就是问题的所在。但你怎么控制大蟒蛇呢？它们无处不在。你不打算买它们，你也不打算把它们赶走。这只是让人们对它们的关心更加淡漠。这会使价格进一步提高，这意味着它们将被更多地繁殖。你在做与积极名单应该帮助的事情相反，那就是特定物种的动物福利。

English Version:
And then there are some species that don't deserve to be kept in captivity. And that's absolutely fine. I don't know whether we need a list because how is it going to be policed? You don't know what's in my home. It's nothing bad, I've just got two snakes, I promise. But there are many instances where people are keeping hundreds of different species of animals in tubs stacked up in the house. And how are you going to police that? Because the local authorities don't care about animal welfare. They don't care. And the RSPCA are unnecessary. And that's a shame to say because they're a charity and we should not be relying on a charity because it's the law. It's literally the law. It's what local authorities should be enforcing. 

Chinese Version:
然后有一些物种不应该被关在笼子里。这是完全正确的。我不知道我们是否需要一个名单，因为这个名单将如何被执行呢？你不知道我的家里有什么。没什么坏的，我只有两条蛇，我保证。但有很多情况下，人们在家里的桶里养了成百上千种不同的动物。你怎么去管控呢？因为地方当局不关心动物福利。他们不在乎。而且RSPCA是不必要的。这是可惜的，因为他们是一个慈善机构，我们不应该依赖慈善机构，因为这是法律。这就是法律。这是地方当局应该执行的。

English Version:
And anyone can bring an animal welfare conviction against someone else for up to three years. Anyone can do it. Do you know how to go about getting someone convicted for an animal welfare violation? Most people don't. No, I know. Like anyone can do it. Like you can. Yeah. Where'd you go? Yeah, that's the thing. You go to the local authority or the police. The police don't want to know. They don't care. They've got other things to be doing. They're already understaffed. They don't want to know about your mate's dog being a bit sad on top of everything else. Your local authority is very understaffed so they don't want to know and it's just one person doing an array of jobs. It comes under environmental so they're doing all of the takeaway licenses plus all the rat stuff and then animal laws sit on top of that and they don't have a clue. They do not know. So they dish it all over to the RSPCA who also don't know that much about exotics. There's nobody. You cannot enforce it in the UK. It is either complaints. The complaints that we've made. And even from dangerous World keeping unlicensed dangerous wild animals and just some random dude. 

Chinese Version:
任何人都可以对他人提起动物福利罪名，最高可达三年。任何人都可以这么做。你知道如何让某人因违反动物福利法而被定罪吗？大多数人都不知道。不，我知道。任何人都可以这么做。你也可以。是的。你去哪里？是的，这就是问题。你去地方当局或警察。警察不想知道。他们不在乎。他们还有其他的事情要做。他们已经人手不足了。他们不想知道你朋友的狗有点难过的事情。你的地方当局人手非常不足，所以他们不想知道，而且只有一个人在做一系列的工作。它属于环保部门，所以他们在做所有的外卖许可证以及所有的鼠类问题，然后动物法律在这之上，他们一无所知。他们不知道。所以他们把所有的工作都推给了RSPCA，而RSPCA对异国动物也知之甚少。在英国，你无法执行这个法律。这只是一些投诉。我们所提的投诉。甚至包括从危险的世界里非法饲养危险野生动物，还有一些随机的家伙。

English Version:
He was keeping dangerous scorpions and breeding them and selling them on Facebook. So it's knowledge that you can feel. And he's got kids in his house and he's letting these scorpions run across the table. And I'm thinking someone's going to die. Someone's going to die. I better do something about it. So I contacted the local authority and she said, "Well, have you got his name?" This is his name. "Have you got an address?" I said no. "What do you want us to do then?" Alright, good point. But still, surely you should look into it because I can guarantee if that man had not paid his tax, they would know his full history, his blood type and everything. And I said nobody ate this morning. If it was to do with tax, which is why I always tell people now, if there's anything to do with breeding and animal welfare don't go down the animal welfare route. Go through the tax because the tax man will come and he'll bring everything with him. Whereas animal welfare will not finish it. They will not care. But if you owe the tax man for breeding puppies or anything like that, I hate it. I really hate it. But it's the only way that you can get any sense of justice. 

Chinese Version:
他在养殖危险的蝎子，然后在Facebook上繁殖和销售它们。所以这是你可以感觉到的知识。他的房子里有孩子，他让这些蝎子在桌子上跑来跑去。我在想有人会死的。有人会死的。我最好做点什么。所以我联系了地方当局，她说：“好吧，你有他的名字吗？”这就是他的名字。“你有地址吗？”我说没有。“那你想让我们做什么？”好吧，说得好。但是，你应该调查一下，因为我可以保证如果那个人没有交税，他们会知道他的全部历史，他的血型和所有的事情。我说没人吃早餐。如果是和税有关的事情，这就是为什么我现在总是告诉人们，如果有任何和繁殖和动物福利有关的事情，不要走动物福利的路。通过税收，因为税务人员会来，他会带走所有的东西。而动物福利不会解决这个问题。他们不会在乎。但是如果你欠税务人员繁殖小狗或其他任何东西的税，我讨厌它。我真的很恨。但这是你能得到任何公正感的唯一方式。

Animal welfare will not finish it, they will not care. But if you owe the tax man on bred puppies or anything like that, I hate it. I really hate it. But it's the only way that you can get any sense of justice. Well, this is the thing, everyone says the RSPCA doesn't do anything. The problem is they have to rely on the police. The police are the ones that break in, the police are the ones that get their warrant. They're the ones that the RSPCA can't do that. They are a charity, they have no more rights than me and you. But they can bring private prosecution and they have the money to be able to get the good lawyers to be able to see that. So that's where they do come in handy. But again, if it's stretched, then there's only so much they can do. And they very rarely go to court. It's so rare that it goes to courtroom that people are convicted. And it's sad, it's so sad. But what can you do?

Chinese Version:
第16部分，
动物福利组织不会解决问题，他们并不关心。但是如果你欠税，无论是因为繁育的小狗或者其他任何东西，我讨厌这种情况。我真的很讨厌。但这是你能获得任何正义感的唯一方式。问题在于，每个人都说RSPCA无所作为。问题是他们必须依靠警察。警察是那些闯入的人，警察是那些得到搜查令的人。RSPCA无法做到这一点。他们是一个慈善机构，他们的权利并不比我们多。但是他们可以提起私人起诉，他们有钱请到好的律师。所以他们在这方面确实有用。但是，如果他们的资源过于紧张，那么他们能做的也就那么多。他们很少能走到法庭上。能走到法庭并且被定罪的人非常少。这很令人伤心，真的很伤心。但你能做什么呢？

English Version:
And like for us, it's like the when it goes to case, it's horrific for the animal. The animal has to sit for years in a box until that verdict comes through. Which is then, what are you doing it for? Because that person gets a slap on the wrist in a £500 fine, if that. Even because obviously you have to gather all the evidence, it has to go to the CPS, they have to decide whether there's enough evidence to prosecute or not. You can't just, you know, you can't take someone to small claims court. But it's not in for that instance. And the horrific acts that we've seen, and some of them have been really bad.

Chinese Version:
对于我们来说，当案子被提起时，对动物来说是可怕的。动物必须在笼子里待上好几年，直到判决结果出来。那么，你为什么要这么做呢？因为那个人可能只会被罚款500英镑，甚至可能没有。显然，你必须收集所有的证据，必须提交给公诉部门，他们必须决定是否有足够的证据进行起诉。你不能只是，你知道，你不能把某人带到小额诉讼法庭。但在这种情况下，它并不适用。我们看到的恶行，其中一些真的很糟糕。

English Version:
I just, in one moment of traffic link, when he was taken to court, he got a fine and he was still allowed to keep all his animals and still be able to be an animal encounter company because it was his business. 

Chinese Version:
我只是，在交通链接的一瞬间，当他被带到法庭上时，他被罚款，但仍然被允许保留所有的动物，并且仍然能够经营动物接触公司，因为那是他的生意。

English Version:
And I was not, I said I was not involved in that case and I do not know about the story. I've heard bad things about it and what has I understand it, the guy got way over his head, which happens a lot. Hoarding is a very big issue in Exotics keeping, a massive issue especially in the animal entertainment side. It is a massive issue, animal hoarding and you do easily become overwhelmed when you've got all that care and then it snowballs as an effect. So I can sympathize with these people, definitely. But it doesn't necessarily mean I understand them because there are ways of going about things.

Chinese Version:
我没有参与那个案子，我不了解那个故事。我听说过一些不好的事情，我理解的是，那个人的问题超出了他的控制，这种情况经常发生。在养殖奇异动物中，囤积是一个非常大的问题，尤其在动物娱乐方面。这是一个巨大的问题，动物囤积，当你需要负责所有的照顾时，你很容易感到压力过大，然后问题就像雪球一样滚动。所以我可以同情这些人，当然。但这并不一定意味着我理解他们，因为有处理事情的方法。

English Version:
But you've got a slap on the wrist, nothing more. Didn't take his animals off him because it's his business. The animals that suffered, no, you can go back, just promise me you won't do it again. All right, I promise. Well, ban you from keeping animals for 10 years is, who's gonna know what's in your house? Who's gonna know you've got snakes?

Chinese Version:
但是你只是被轻轻地敲了一下手腕，没有更多的惩罚。他的动物没有被没收，因为那是他的生意。那些受苦的动物，不，你可以回去，只要你答应我你不会再这样做。好的，我答应。那么，禁止你养动物10年，谁会知道你家里有什么？谁会知道你养了蛇？

English Version:
Well, that's the thing. Like what does the band do? Because she can go into a pet shop, no one goes, do you have a license? Have you been mine? It's the same with DWA. To sell DWA, I don't need a license to sell you DWA and I don't need to see your license to prove that you can keep DWA. All I need to do is say, you know, this needs a license and you go yeah and I should send the paperwork through to your local authority just to say that this person's but I don't need to see your license for it to be legally sold. Which is mad.

Chinese Version:
那就是问题所在。禁令能做什么？因为她可以走进宠物店，没有人会问，你有许可证吗？你有矿吗？DWA也是一样。卖DWA，我不需要许可证就可以卖给你DWA，我也不需要看你的许可证就可以证明你可以养DWA。我需要做的就是说，你知道，这需要许可证，你说好，我应该把文件送到你的地方政府，就是说这个人，但是我不需要看你的许可证就可以合法销售。这真是疯了。

English Version:
And that's dangerous. I could buy myself a tiger if I wanted to that way. But it's not enforceable because nobody enforces it. And all these laws, all these white lists, all these positive lists are fantastic on paper. And look how great we're doing as a country for animal welfare. And when it comes to enforcement, it means nothing. We enforce nothing. My worry is that people are already against taking exotics to the vet. And then you bring out a list and then they won't take it to the vet because then they'll get prosecuted. Well, their fear of prosecution is seriously. They're going to get prosecuted. But it's the same as going to the vets, obviously being judged by vets. And

Part 17 begins with discussing hobbies and laws that are unenforceable. The speaker believes it will take time for change due to the old-fashioned views of those at the top. The speaker suggests that we need to wait for a new wave of generation to come through. This process is starting, but it's not quite there yet. The speaker also argues that reptile keeping has advanced more than any other animal hobby in the last 30 years. The husbandry has progressed from animals not living for five months to keeping them for the rest of their lives. The speaker believes this change can be done, it's just a matter of whether the hobbyists are willing to accept the conclusions.

Chinese Version:
第17部分开始讨论爱好和无法执行的法律。演讲者认为，由于顶层人物的观念过于陈旧，改变需要时间。演讲者提出，我们需要等待新一代的到来。这个过程已经开始，但还没有完全到位。演讲者还指出，在过去的30年里，爬行动物养护比任何其他动物爱好进步得更快。饲养技术已经从动物只能活五个月进步到可以把它们养活一生。演讲者认为这种改变是可以做到的，只是看爱好者是否愿意接受这些结论。

English Version: 
The speaker then discusses the context of animal rights and the moral justification of keeping animals. If it's unenforceable and unchangeable, then there's not much you can do about it. The speaker states that if you want to keep an animal, you can, there's nothing stopping you. However, there's no real justification behind keeping the animal other than for your own benefit. This applies to many species, not just reptiles. The speaker argues that just because you do something, doesn't mean it's right. The same applies to the law, just because something is legal, doesn't mean it's right.

Chinese Version:
演讲者接着讨论了动物权益的背景和养动物的道德合理性。如果法律无法执行并且无法改变，那么你也无能为力。演讲者表明，如果你想养动物，你可以养，没有什么能阻止你。然而，养动物除了满足你自己的需求之外，并没有真正的合理性。这适用于许多物种，不仅仅是爬行动物。演讲者辩称，仅仅因为你做了某事，并不意味着它就是对的。法律也是如此，仅仅因为某事是合法的，并不意味着它就是正确的。

English Version: 
The speaker then questions whether people with extreme animal rights beliefs, who are against keeping reptiles, are working towards something they can't enforce. The speaker believes that bans haven't been put in place because the government knows they're unenforceable. Implementing bans costs a lot of money and effort, which the government is unwilling to spend. The speaker criticizes the government's animal welfare efforts as nothing more than a checklist to show they've done something, without any real meaning or impact.

Chinese Version:
演讲者接着质疑，那些极端的动物权益主义者，他们反对养爬行动物，是否正在为他们无法执行的事情而努力。演讲者认为，政府没有实施禁令，因为他们知道这些禁令是无法执行的。实施禁令需要花费大量的金钱和精力，而政府并不愿意付出。演讲者批评政府的动物福利工作，只不过是为了显示他们已经做了一些事情的清单，没有任何真正的意义或影响。

English Version: 
The speaker concludes by stating that our interactions with animals are a part of our history as a species and it would be a shame if that were to stop. The speaker also questions whether pushing for certain rights might cause more problems for animal welfare. The speaker notes that when it comes to animal welfare, society is very utilitarian. Animal rights don't get much attention because they don't make money, unlike animal agriculture and pet keeping. The speaker also mentions their experience working as an animal lab technician, stating that it was an important experience for understanding animal welfare.

Chinese Version:
演讲者最后指出，我们与动物的互动是我们作为一个物种历史的一部分，如果这种互动停止了，那将是一种遗憾。演讲者也质疑，推动某些权利可能会给动物福利带来更多的问题。演讲者指出，当谈到动物福利时，社会是非常功利的。与动物农业和宠物养护不同，动物权利并没有获得太多的关注，因为它们不能赚钱。演讲者还提到他们作为动物实验室技术员的工作经验，称这是理解动物福利的重要经历。

Part 18
I used to work with mice. I was just an animal care technician, so it was nothing special. I didn't do any of the licensed activities or stuff. I just wanted to see what it was like because if I was going to work in animal welfare, I needed to see every aspect of it. That was just a license I wanted to work under. So, I did three months of it and it was not what I expected at all. Most of it is just keeping in mind that there were about 5,000 mice and only about four of them were actually used. The rest of them were obviously just in boxes. It was very strictly controlled. They had to have two levels, stuff to gnaw on, and a digable substrate. They had to be kept in groups and their welfare was actually better protected than in pet shops. That was because they were used for human testing. They didn't really know any different. It was just thousands of mice in boxes getting their waters changed twice a week.

我曾经与老鼠一起工作。我只是一名动物护理技术员，所以并没有什么特别的。我没有做任何许可的活动或者其他事情。我只是想看看这是什么样的，因为如果我要从事动物福利工作，我需要了解它的每一个方面。这只是我想要从事的许可工作。所以，我做了三个月的这项工作，这并不是我预期的。大部分只是记住，有大约5000只老鼠，只有大约四只实际上被使用。其余的显然只是在盒子里。这是非常严格控制的。它们必须有两层，可以啃咬的东西，和可以挖掘的基质。它们必须被保持在群体中，它们的福利实际上比在宠物店中得到了更好的保护。这是因为它们被用于人类测试。它们并不真正了解任何不同。这只是成千上万的老鼠在盒子里，每周换两次水。

English Version:
I find it a little sad to tell you this, but I want to double back to what you said about the government not listening to animal rights because it doesn't make money. In our country, the overwhelming opinion of most reptile keepers is that we all think that the government's got animal rights whispering in their ear and they're listening to it all. They don't really care. That makes me laugh the most. Most of the times when they're talking about how the animal rights are doing this and that, it's not animal welfare but the Animal Welfare says you need to treat these animals better. They go "Whoa, hold on. That's not really cool. That's not cash money of you to say that." That's what they think is animal rights. It's not animal rights, it's literally Animal Welfare going, "You're treating these animals poorly. Treat them better." And they're going, "Hmm, how dare you take our hobby away from us because I can't keep a snake in a box." That's what it is when it comes to actual animal rights.

Chinese Version:
我觉得有点遗憾要告诉你这个，但我想回到你关于政府不听动物权利的说法，因为这并不能赚钱。在我们国家，大多数爬行动物饲养员的压倒性观点是，我们都认为政府有动物权利在他们耳边低语，他们听到了所有的内容。他们并不真正关心。这让我笑得最开心。大多数时候，当他们在谈论动物权利如何做这做那的时候，实际上不是动物福利，而是动物福利说你需要更好地对待这些动物。他们会说，“哇，等等。这真的不酷。这不是你说的现金。”那就是他们认为的动物权利。这不是动物权利，实际上是动物福利说，“你对待这些动物的方式很差。你应该更好地对待他们。”他们会说，“嗯，你怎么敢因为我不能把蛇放在盒子里就把我们的爱好从我们身边夺走。”这就是实际的动物权利。

English Version:
When you're looking at the working groups and things like that, you will have them be a part of the conversation at least, but they're not necessarily given the time of day because again, it's not making any money for the government. We're not talking a couple of quid here, you're talking hundreds of billions of pounds of revenue that's made by animal agriculture. That's why you'll never get rid of it. It's too ingrained in our society to get rid of, but you can try and make it slightly better because it hasn't always been. Ethically, yes, but mass production has made it a lot worse in that sense.

Chinese Version:
当你在看工作组和那些东西的时候，你至少会让他们成为对话的一部分，但他们不一定会有时间，因为再次，这并不能为政府赚钱。我们在这里说的不是几个便士，你在说由动物农业创造的数百亿英镑的收入。这就是你永远无法摆脱它的原因。它在我们的社会中根深蒂固，无法摆脱，但你可以试着让它稍微好一点，因为它并不总是这样。从道德角度来看，是的，但是大规模生产在这个意义上让它变得更糟。

English Version:
I think it comes down to a lot of people working on animal welfare also have very strong animal rights beliefs to the opposing end of "it shouldn't be kept". Yes, they do, but they also have the burden of proof upon them. They still have to present evidence. My two lecturers, one of them was Dr. Stephen McCullough, who is a very well-known and respected European voice for animal rights. He knows his science and can argue back with pure facts. Even though he's pro-animal rights, he can back that up.

Chinese Version:
我认为这归结为很多从事动物福利工作的人也有非常强烈的动物权利信念，反对“不应该被保留”。是的，他们确实有，但他们也有证明的责任。他们仍然需要提供证据。我的两位讲师之一是史蒂芬·麦科洛博士，他是欧洲动物权利的一位非常知名且受人尊敬的声音。他知道他的科学，可以用纯粹的事实来反驳。即使他是动物权利的支持者，他也可以证明这一点。

English Version:
Then there was Dr. Andrew Knight, a fantastic guy, a lovely Australian bloke. He's very knowledgeable and more ethical to what you're feeling. But he's for the vegan diets of pets, which is not clearly my viewpoint. I don't necessarily agree with that and I think it's against animal welfare to be honest. But he's also a European opinion, so they come to these people for advice. They're well ingrained within our animal welfare society. They go to all of the seminars and the government working groups and stuff like that. But yes, there will be more animal rights debates but they do have to prove it. You can't just turn up with a picket sign saying "Stop killing chickens. Chickens are our friends." That doesn't come into it at all, not even slightly.

Chinese Version:
然后是安德鲁·奈特博士，一个非常棒的家伙，一个可爱的澳大利亚人。他非常知识渊博，对你的感受更有道德。但他支持宠物的素食饮食，这显然不是我的观点。我不一定同意这一点，我认为坦白说这是违反动物福利的。但他也是欧洲的观点，所以他们来找这些人寻求建议。他们在我们的动物福利社会中根深蒂固。他们参加所有的研讨会和政府工作组等等。但是，是的，会有更多的动物权利辩论，但他们必须证明这一点。你不能只是拿着抗议牌说“停止杀鸡。鸡是我们的朋友。”这根本不能算在内，甚至不能稍微算在内。

English Version:
The same is also true when certain people in the hobby of the older generation or something turn up and say that the staunch opposite of animal rights is taking away our rights to keep pets. That's why they're not listened to either because what argument are you putting forward? Where is your evidence? We need to have animal welfare science and animal welfare ethics together as a whole. It's a multi-modal thing. We need experts from all of the groups coming together and creating working groups, which usually does happen. There will be stakeholders in that as well and there will be people who have financial investments in it going one way or another. You'll never be able to stop that, but we are usually pretty good at listening to scientific evidence, especially when there's a lot of it.

Chinese Version:
当某些老一辈的爱好者出现并说坚决反对动物权利的人正在剥夺我们养宠物的权利时，同样也是如此。这就是为什么他们也不被听取的原因，因为你提出了什么论据？你的证据在哪里？我们需要将动物福利科学和动物福利伦理结合在一起。这是一个多模态的事情。我们需要所有群体的专家聚集在一起，形成工作组，这通常会发生。那也会有利益相关者，也会有人在其中一方或另一方有金融投资。你永远无法阻止那个，但我们通常很擅长听取科学证据，特别是当有很多这样的证据时。

Part 19. Stakeholders are involved in this issue, and there are people who have financial investments that could be affected by the outcome. It's impossible to prevent this, but we are usually pretty good at listening to scientific evidence, especially when it's against our interests. If you're suggesting that we should cut out this two billion pound pet industry, they're going to want to see some evidence to justify that. They're not just going to accept that animals are sad. It's a foolish thing to think, especially when there are people who are arguing that it's justifiable. These people are suggesting that we can push the bar further and make people spend more money. They're trying to get past the animal welfare part by arguing that we create 2 billion pounds of revenue. They don't really have anything to back that up, but it is expensive. I will concede that point. It's true that for the higher welfare things, it is expensive. But are we actually spending that much? I don't think so. 

Chinese Version:
第19部分。这个问题涉及到许多股东，其中有些人的财务投资可能会受到结果的影响。我们无法阻止这一点，但我们通常很擅长听取科学证据，尤其是当这些证据与我们的利益相冲突时。如果你建议我们应该削减这个产值200亿英镑的宠物行业，他们会希望看到一些证据来证明这一点。他们不会仅仅因为动物伤心就接受。这是一种愚蠢的想法，尤其是当有人争辩说这是合理的时候。这些人建议我们可以进一步提高标准，让人们花更多的钱。他们试图通过辩称我们创造了200亿英镑的收入来规避动物福利问题。他们没有真正的证据来支持这一点，但这的确是昂贵的。我承认这一点。的确，对于更高的福利事项，这是昂贵的。但我们真的花了那么多钱吗？我不这么认为。

English Version:
I am fortunate to have all of the gadgets, and there are some gadgets that I don't think are necessary. I don't think UV measurement is unnecessary. I don't find them necessary at all, especially when they cost a couple of hundred pounds. And then if you're just changing your bulbs every six months or something, I don't get why people have those because they last a lot longer than six months. That's why. Hmm, is it? I've saved so much money from having a solar meter just to put under to say okay this is more than two, two, three. So, I've had a T5 which you would normally have changed like after a year and it's like the fourth year now. Really? Yeah, and it's the same, it's not the same. So like 4.5 from a beam, it's now getting like 3.9, but I've just elevated the basking spot slightly to bring it back up to like the fours. So, I've still got a four-year-old T5 for my beardy. That's why they're worth money. Yeah, but for like three, four hundred quid, it depends on how many animals you have. If you have 30 vivs, it probably does make sense. Oh well, there you go then. There you go, yeah, exactly. I didn't think of that. If you've just got like one. Yeah, yeah, you got 40 Vives that need UV change and yeah, I can see how that's going to really come in handy. 

Chinese Version:
我有幸拥有所有的设备，其中有一些设备我认为并不必要。我不认为紫外线测量是不必要的。我根本就不认为他们是必要的，尤其是当他们的价格高达几百英镑时。然后，如果你每六个月或者什么的就换一次灯泡，我不明白人们为什么要这样做，因为它们的使用寿命远远超过六个月。这就是原因。是吗？我从使用太阳能表开始就省了很多钱，只需放在下面就可以说好，这个数字超过了二、二、三。所以，我有一个T5，你通常会在一年后更换它，但现在已经是第四年了。真的吗？是的，它还是一样，不是一样。所以从光束中得到的4.5，现在变成了3.9，但我只是稍微抬高了晒太阳的地方，使它回到了4左右。所以，我仍然有一个四岁的T5给我的胡须龙。这就是它们值钱的原因。是的，但对于三、四百英镑，这取决于你有多少动物。如果你有30个活体展示箱，这可能是有道理的。哦，那你就知道了。是的，没错。我没有想到这一点。如果你只有一个。是的，是的，你有40个活体展示箱需要换紫外线，是的，我可以看到这将会非常方便。

English Version:
But when the Beady's UV goes bad, it drops to the snakes and when it goes even more bad, it goes to the hatchlings. It lays on top but it can be that close to that bad. So every time I buy a new V, I only buy one bulb but I don't replace the lot because they're just getting cascaded down. Yeah, well that's brilliant. He's got two snakes, not necessary. But yeah, I've had a good idea to save money. As I see it, better welfare can be achieved at lower costs. If you understand the equipment, you can really push things further. And I've made videos about it. There are people who know about this now because of this channel, so we're pushing for it. 

Chinese Version:
但是当胡须龙的紫外线变坏时，它会降低到蛇那里，当它变得更糟糕时，它会降低到孵化的小动物那里。它躺在顶部，但它可以离那么糟糕的情况那么近。所以每次我买一个新的V，我只买一个灯泡，但我不替换所有的，因为它们只是被逐步降低了。是的，那真是太棒了。他有两条蛇，不需要。但是，我有一个省钱的好主意。据我看，可以以更低的成本实现更好的福利。如果你了解设备，你真的可以推动事情更进一步。我已经制作了关于这方面的视频。现在有人因为这个频道而了解这个，所以我们正在推动这个。

English Version:
But do you think we'll ever get to a stage where they will implement a positive list, even if it can't be enforced naively? Yeah, I do. I think there will be one. I think they'll go through with it. I think it'll be in the next 18 months because we didn't think that they'd do it with the IIs either and they did. And to be fair, Chris deserves credit for that. He warned everyone and nobody believed him that it was going to go through and it did. Is that the AEO? No, that's the IAS, the invasive species. So that's where they banned coats and some chipmunks and raccoons, which were big in the Exotics Community. They were looking at banning some other stuff as well, adding to the IES, but they didn't make it. So, that was European based though. Brexit might change that now. Well, they just wrote it into domestic law even though it had nothing to do with the UK. Raccoons were not an issue for us. They were in Germany, but not here. They still just wrote it into domestic legislation. So, they're still banned for no reason. 

Chinese Version:
但你认为我们会达到一个阶段，他们会实施一个积极的清单，即使它不能天真地执行吗？是的，我认为会有一个。我认为他们会实施它。我认为这将在接下来的18个月内，因为我们原本认为他们不会对IIs采取行动，但他们却做了。公平地说，Chris应该为此获得赞扬。他警告了所有人，没有人相信他说这件事会通过，但它确实通过了。那是AEO吗？不，那是IAS，入侵物种。所以这就是他们禁止外套和一些花栗鼠和浣熊的地方，这些在异国情调社区中很重要。他们还考虑禁止一些其他的东西，添加到IES，但他们没有做到。所以，那是基于欧洲的。现在英国脱欧可能会改变这一点。嗯，他们只是把它写入国内法律，尽管它与英国无关。浣熊对我们来说不是问题。他们在德国，但不在这里。他们仍然只是把它写入国内法规。所以，他们仍然无缘无故地被禁止。

English Version:
So, I like to ask your opinion. My opinions? I think the hobby should produce its own positive lists because we're the only ones with the contextual understanding of what we keep, what's viable to keep without it to the detriment of the animal. But I mean like not like those snacks and things like that. I think we should be making our own positive list ahead of time and then when they do decide that they're going to make a positive list, there's ours, well justified. Do you think that as well? Yeah, I do. I think that should be done whether it goes forward to government or not. I think that's the best way that this can be enforced is literally through the hobby itself in talking to other people. Unfortunately, it does come with "well, why are you keeping that?" For you know, times have changed now, we're not doing that anymore. And that's the only way that I think that can be effectively policed. I don't think that there's any other logical way to do this and we have been doing it ourselves. There was a big part of getting rid of the...

Chinese Version:
所以，我想问问你的意见。我的意见？我认为这个爱好应该产生自己的积极清单，因为我们是唯一了解我们保持什么，没有它对动物有害的可行性的人。但我并不是说像那些零食和东西那样。我认为我们应该提前制定自己的积极清单，然后当他们决定要制定一个积极清单时，这就是我们的，理由充分。你也这么认为吗？是的，我认为这应该做，无论它是否向政府推进。我认为这是可以真正通过爱好自身来和其他人交谈来执行的最好方式。不幸的是，它确实带来了“哦，你为什么要保存那个？”你知道，现在的时代已经改变了，我们不再那样做了。我认为这是唯一有效的警察方式。我不认为有其他任何合理的方式来做这件事，我们一直在自己做。摆脱这个占了很大一部分...

The only way I think that can be effectively policed, I don't think there's any other logical way to do this. We've been doing it ourselves, you know. There was a big part of getting rid of certain genes in Royal Pythons that caused neurological issues and spiders and the spider morphs or whatever it was. In the carpet pythons, we've discouraged them a lot. It's been pretty successful in the main hobby. People did stop for quite a while. You're not going to reach the entire hobby in general because there are ones that aren't a part of the internet basis or still rely purely on shops. Shops have a big part to play. We should have our own positive list and I think we will start to because if we don't do it, someone else will. It's better if we do it and take accountability and put forward things then to wait for somebody else to do it because they will be doing it. It's better to dictate rather than be dictated to. It looks better to us as well. 

Chinese version:
我认为这是唯一可以有效执行的方式，我不认为还有其他合理的方式来做这个。我们一直在自己做，你知道的。我们成功去除了皇家蟒蛇中导致神经问题的某些基因，以及蜘蛛和蜘蛛突变体等。在地毯蟒蛇中，我们极力劝阻它们。在主流爱好中，这已经相当成功。人们确实停下来了相当长的一段时间。你不可能触及到整个爱好，因为有些人并不是互联网基础的一部分，或者仍然完全依赖商店。商店在这里扮演着重要的角色。我们应该有自己的积极名单，我认为我们将开始这样做，因为如果我们不这样做，别人会这样做。我们最好自己做，并负起责任，然后等待别人做，因为他们会这样做。最好是主导而不是被主导。这对我们来说看起来更好。

English version:
We've come back and decided that this live feeding snake is not particularly good to be kept in captivity. So, this should be put forward for a ban. There are going to be times where someone can keep this snake perfectly and it's great, but in general, as the general population, this cannot be kept well and therefore should not be kept at all. That's utilitarianism. Do you think they should be made and kept close to your chest and when you find out they're going to do it, slap yours down or just go ahead and announce yours ahead of time so they go with it anyway?

Chinese version:
我们已经回来并决定这种需要活饵的蛇不适合被圈养。所以，应该提出禁止这种行为。会有一些时候，有人可以完美地饲养这种蛇，这很好，但总的来说，作为大众，这种蛇不能被良好地饲养，因此根本不应该被饲养。这就是功利主义。你认为他们应该被制造并保持在你的胸前，当你发现他们要做的时候，压制你的反应，还是直接提前宣布你的意见，让他们无论如何都要接受？

English version:
You can announce it ahead of time, but either way, it makes no difference unless there's specifically an issue where they're inviting for your opinion. You can't just turn up to the government and say we're going to ban these. There's no one to know where to go. It has to be a part of a working group. Do you think that the government listens to the voices of those that have a stakeholder of a direct hobby as much as they do to the reverse?

Chinese version:
你可以提前宣布，但无论哪种方式，除非有特定的问题需要你的意见，否则都没有区别。你不能只是出现在政府面前说我们要禁止这些。没有人知道该去哪里。这必须是一个工作小组的一部分。你认为政府是否会像听取反对方的声音一样，听取那些直接参与爱好的利益相关者的声音？

English version:
I think that the government listens to the people that make the most money and what's going to cost the least amount to do. I don't really think the government cares about animal welfare. It's not high on their list. They've got other priorities to consider. I don't know how that's going to change with governments. I'm pretty sure services are not going to stay in. I think that will change. I think potentially we will be looking at a labor government next. It's just the way how it's gone.

Chinese version:
我认为政府会倾听那些能赚最多钱的人以及做什么会花最少的钱。我不认为政府真的关心动物福利。这不在他们的优先考虑之列。他们有其他的优先事项需要考虑。我不知道这将如何在政府中改变。我很确定服务不会保留。我想这会改变。我认为我们可能会在下次看到一个工党政府。这只是它的发展方式。

English version:
I don't particularly know what labor's stance is. I think labor is a little more towards animal rights than they are at least with the conservatives. Everything's down to money. That's what you can trust more of. If it's going to make you the most money, it's not likely to be banned. Otherwise, it's a little bit different. 

Chinese version:
我并不特别了解工党的立场。我认为工党在动物权益问题上比保守派更为倾向。一切都归结为金钱。这是你可以更多的信任的东西。如果它能让你赚最多的钱，那么它不太可能被禁止。否则，情况就有点不同了。

English version:
The Green Party, for example, is quite animal rights-based. They are much more focused on animal rights. I don't know with them. It's a bit different per area. We're then talking about whether or not it's enforceable. It doesn't really matter if it's going to happen anyway.

Chinese version:
例如，绿党非常基于动物权益。他们对动物权益的关注要多得多。我不知道他们的情况。每个地区都有些不同。我们接着讨论的是这是否可行。如果它无论如何都要发生，那么这真的没关系。

English version:
Even if you've got something that's going to be banned, it's better that we ban it and it not be actually banned because at least then they can still access veterinary care whenever they want. It's no issue on that. You just have a better pressure from the hobby itself than from the law where people are just going to say well, I'll keep what I want. 

Chinese version:
即使你有一些东西将要被禁止，我们最好还是禁止它，而不是真的被禁止，因为至少他们仍然可以随时获得兽医护理。这不是问题。你只是从爱好本身得到了比从法律更大的压力，人们只会说，好吧，我会保留我想要的。

English version:
So, you're almost suggesting that culturally we try and embody a culture of these things we want to keep and just as our guidelines and suggestions. Rather than going to the government, we suggest if it's asked as a working group then we can go up and say, you know what, these are the ones that aren't doing very well. Let's keep these off the good list of being kept. 

Chinese version:
所以，你几乎是在建议，从文化上，我们试图体现我们想要保持的这些事物的文化，就像我们的指导方针和建议一样。与其去找政府，我们建议如果被问到作为一个工作小组，那么我们可以站出来说，你知道吗，这些是那些表现不好的。让我们把这些从被保留的好名单上移除。

English version:
I think that we can work together in that aspect and it can be very successful. I know it's going to come, it will come and I just think it's better to be prepared than to have it be a big shock. Do you think like a minimum size guidelines will happen before the list comes in? 

Chinese version:
我认为我们可以在这方面共同努力，并且可以非常成功。我知道它将会来临，它会来临，我只是认为准备好比被打个大惊小怪要好。你认为在名单出现之前，会有最小尺寸的指导方针吗？

English version:
Yes, I think they're coming in. It's officially announced everything comes in October. I'm still waiting for some other things to come in. They're very sneaky with these Octobers. But it will eventually come in again. Then I had like, I don't know what to say, it just leaves you reeling.

For some other things to come in, they're very sneaky with these Octobers, but it will eventually come in again. Then I had like, I'm going to place that one, but you know, I don't know what to say. It just leaves you reeling. I don't think it's probably going to follow the same route as the Germans' headlines for things that you can be prosecuted against – like, you're not meeting that minimum welfare standard because you're not meeting that guideline. At the moment, for free, no, that's... there was a lot of, most of the exotic mammals and things. I said not most at all, some of the exotic mammals that come in, they're called European specials and that usually means they've come from Germany where they're bred quite prolifically over there and they have some fantastic collections of exotic mammals that get brought over, some really good ones.

第21部分
对于一些其他的事情来说，他们在这些十月份里非常狡猾，但最终还是会再次出现。然后我有一种感觉，我会放在那里，但你知道，我不知道该说什么。这让你感到震惊。我不认为它可能会沿着与德国的头条新闻相同的路线，你可能会因为某些事情而被起诉-比如，你没有达到最低的福利标准，因为你没有达到那个准则。目前，免费的，不，那是...有很多，大部分的异国哺乳动物和事物。我说的并不是大部分，而是一些进来的异国哺乳动物，他们被称为欧洲特产，这通常意味着他们来自德国，在那里他们被大量繁殖，并且他们有一些非常棒的异国哺乳动物收藏，被带到了其他地方，一些非常好的。

English Version:
But they've been like a snake species or something like that, but you can transport over robot mama, that's fine. But no corn snakes or something like that. So it's... it makes no sense in a lot of it. I don't think they realize how many exotic animals are actually kept. That's what I think they're missing is a big part of the species and the number that is actually kept because it's lots. And I've only got the numbers from licensed activities and that's a lot. You know, just hippos and camels and lions and tigers and there's some shocking spaces on there where you think, yeah, yeah 65,000 speak at our species or just individual animals, individual animals. So 65,000 individual animals in exotic encounters alone, let alone the rest of the industry. Yes, that... so, that is literally just on what's available as a licensed activity and this is out of date now.

Chinese Version:
但他们就像蛇类或者类似的东西，但你可以运送过来的机器人妈妈，那是可以的。但是没有玉米蛇或者类似的东西。所以它的...它在很多方面都没有任何意义。我不认为他们意识到实际上有多少异国动物被饲养。我认为他们遗漏的是物种的大部分和实际饲养的数量，因为这是大量的。而我只是从许可的活动中得到了这些数字，这是很多。你知道，只有河马、骆驼、狮子和老虎，还有一些令人震惊的空间，你会想，是的，是的，65,000种物种或者只是个体动物，个体动物。所以仅在异国动物遭遇中就有65,000个个体动物，更不用说整个行业了。是的，那...所以，那实际上只是作为许可活动的可用物种，而这现在已经过时了。

Part 22
Some of my snakes will live at least 60 years. They're not going to take those animals away from me. As long as that doesn't happen, what am I upset about? I'm content. If someone said to you tomorrow, "We're going to ban animal keeping altogether. No one's allowed pets anymore, apart from domestics," how would you feel? It's difficult because I would be upset if they were going to take my animals away and pet them. But if that wasn't going to happen, then I would be content. If from now on everything that you've got has grandfather rights, meaning you can't keep anything else from now on, would you keep any more? I think I would be at the state of "fair enough." If that means that all the animals that I know suffer aren't going to suffer anymore, then I'll be content. 

Chinese Version:
第22部分
我的一些蛇至少能活60年。他们不会把这些动物从我这里带走。只要不发生这种情况，我有什么好烦恼的呢？我很满足。如果有人明天对你说，“我们将全面禁止饲养动物。除了家养动物，任何人都不允许再养宠物”，你会有什么感觉？这很困难，因为如果他们要把我的动物带走并宠物化，我会很难过。但是如果那不会发生，那么我会感到满足。如果从现在开始，你已经拥有的一切都有祖父的权利，也就是说你不能再养任何其他的动物，你还会再养吗？我想我会处在“公平”的状态。如果这意味着我知道的所有受苦的动物不再受苦，那么我会感到满足。

English Version:
Like say, grandfather rights, there will still be tortoises in 200 years. That doesn't selfishly affect me, it affects the next generation. It's just exasperation. The people who need to be there, I'm not going to include myself in that, but people like you guys, you're getting worn down by it. You can only take so much before it starts to really affect your mental health. You have to leave for your own benefit because you just can't take it anymore. It happens, unfortunately, a lot. So there's no one left to fight for it, just the ones that shouldn't be. I think the benefit of this is that we make money from it, so I'm more content with it. 

Chinese Version:
比如说，祖父的权利，200年后仍会有乌龟。这并不会自私地影响我，它会影响下一代。这只是无奈。需要在那里的人，我不会把自己包括在内，但像你们这样的人，你们被它消磨得精疲力尽。你只能承受那么多，直到它真的开始影响你的心理健康。你必须为了自己的利益离开，因为你再也无法忍受。不幸的是，这种情况经常发生。所以没有人剩下来为它战斗，只剩下那些不应该在的人。我认为这的好处是我们可以从中赚钱，所以我对此更满意。

English Version:
Making money is a generally nice thing to do. What's it like? That's alright. Positive lists will come in. We should do it in our own hobby first, but we're all tired. But also, you've got to think about, you create a list so large that it is basically not a positive list anymore. You might as well not buy anything because, yes. I would say I genuinely couldn't think now, maybe three or four species. I know definitely not large-bodied snakes. I'd take off anacondas, retics, pythons, the big ones. The any live-eating snakes which are just the angry shoelace ones. But I can't think of anything much else that's really bad. All the stuff that's been kept badly is the good species though, like corn snakes and bearded dragons. Those are good species to keep. They're really good key species to keep, but they're the ones being kept badly because there's more of them. 

Chinese Version:
赚钱是一件非常好的事。这是什么感觉？那还可以。积极的清单会出现。我们应该首先在自己的爱好中做这件事，但我们都很累。但你也得想想，你创建的清单如此之大，基本上就不再是积极的清单了。你可能根本就不需要买任何东西，因为，是的。我现在真的想不出来，可能只有三四种物种。我知道肯定不是大型蛇。我会去掉巨蟒、网蟒、蟒蛇，那些大的。还有任何生吃的蛇，就是那些愤怒的鞋带蛇。但我想不出还有什么真正糟糕的东西。所有被糟糕地饲养的都是好的物种，比如玉米蛇和胡须龙。那些是好的饲养物种。他们是非常好的关键物种，但他们被糟糕地饲养是因为他们的数量更多。

English Version:
I think the compromise is if you look at the Belgian positive list. There is the list which is no questions asked, you can have this. Then there's the ones in a separate provisional list where a veterinarian has to look at your house to see if it meets the minimum housing guidelines before you get the animal. If they pass it, you can have it. So you could put giants from that provisional list. That's the compromise, not a complete ban. But you would need to just whack them on the DWA, just as well whack around something that's already in place. For me, some of the decisions, like why retics aren't on a DWA, is quite confusing to me. 

Chinese Version:
我认为妥协的方式是看看比利时的积极清单。有一份清单，不问任何问题，你可以拥有这个。然后在另一份临时清单中，有一些需要兽医先查看你的房子，看看是否满足最低的住房指南，然后你才能得到动物。如果他们通过了，你就可以拥有它。所以你可以把那个临时清单中的巨人放进去。这是妥协，而不是完全禁止。但你需要把他们放在DWA上，就像随便在已经存在的东西上敲打一样。对我来说，有些决定，比如为什么网蟒不在DWA上，对我来说很困惑。

English Version:
For example, an otter. You're like, "It's basically kind of like what accidents there are, the causes of accidents." So with otters, there's been a few where they've bitten people's fingers off. But there's no real evidence, bar some speculation and maybe one case of a giant snake killing someone in the UK at least. But if you actually look at the DWA statistics, I think there's been maybe one or two people who have actually been killed by DWAs in the 40 something years, 50 years, I can't count backwards, that the license has been there. There's been barely any incidents. Whereas every year there are quite a few deaths from dogs, cattle, and cats tripping over the bastards. 

Chinese Version:
例如，水獭。你会想，“基本上就是有什么事故，事故的原因。”所以对于水獭，有几个例子是它们咬掉了人们的手指。但是没有真正的证据，除了一些猜测和可能有一个巨蟒在英国至少杀了一个人的案例。但如果你真正看看DWA的统计数据，我认为在许可证存在的40多年，50年里，可能有一两个人实际上被DWA杀死。几乎没有任何事件。然而，每年都有很多人死于狗、牛和猫绊倒的事故。

English Version:
There's even choking on napkins and stuff, you know, there's deaths from that, but not with DWAs. But yeah, they're on the list. It's just an already existing list that has a set of rules in place that most local authorities are aware of, and it can be manageably done. Or you know, what would be even better is if local authorities started hiring qualified people in animal welfare. Could you imagine? Could you imagine that? Actual qualified people in animal welfare who knew the law. What a world! But no, they're not going to do that because they don't have the budget to do it. 

Chinese Version:
甚至还有人因为窒息纸巾和其他东西而死，你知道，有那样的死亡，但DWA没有。但是，它们在清单上。这只是一个已经存在的清单，上面有一套大多数地方当局都知道的规则，可以管理得当。或者，你知道，如果地方当局开始雇佣合格的动物福利人员，那就更好了。你能想象吗？你能想象吗？真正了解法律的合格动物福利人员。多么美好的世界！但是，他们不会这么做，因为他们没有预算去做。

English Version:
But food for thought for a lot of viewers. Whether you reach a stage of apathy, we've just got to if you don't get to the end of this and you're like, "Well then," then you're pressing right. And on that note, I think we are. It's half four now, so we've been going for a long time. So the question from the last guest was about the moon of size guidelines, but we've already really covered it. Thank you so much for coming on, Jen. Also, a random question for the next guest, you won't know who it is, a question that you would like to ask and they'd have to answer, "What's the lethal dose of hedgehogs?" Okay, thank you so much for coming on, Jen. That's okay, no problem. Thank you again, Jennifer, for coming on the podcast. 

Chinese Version:
但是，这给许多观众留下了深思。无论你是否达到了冷漠的阶段，我们只有当你没有到达这个的尽头，你就会说，“那么”，那么你就是在按正确的方向。在这个问题上，我想我们是。现在是四点半，所以我们已经进行了很长时间。所以上一位嘉宾的问题是关于月亮大小的指南，但我们已经真正地覆盖了它。非常感谢你来参加，詹。另外，对下一位嘉宾的一个随机问题，你不会知道他是谁，你想问的问题，他们必须回答，“刺猬的致命剂量是多少？”好的，非常感谢你来参加，詹。没问题，没问题。再次感谢你，詹妮弗，来参加播客。

Part 23 is a question that you would like to ask. "What's the lethal dose of hedgehogs?" Okay, I know. Thank you so much for coming on, Jen. That's okay, no problem. Thank you again, Jennifer, for coming on the podcast. This is a really good conversation and it's just a lot of food for thought for a lot of people. Whether they agree or disagree with some thoughts expressed in this episode, it's really healthy to have other people that might challenge the way that you think.

So, thank you so much for listening through all of this and being a part of us in this conversation. If you want to help us and support us in making the content of this show, then you can head on over to Patreon slash Reptiles and Research. But other than that, we'll see you in the next episode.

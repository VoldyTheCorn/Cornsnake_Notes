English transcription of paragraph 1:
This video essay explores the proposition of one paper aimed at Animal Welfare. For the purpose of this essay, I'm going to focus on captive culture and tie it back to snakes and lizards.

Chinese translation of paragraph 1:
此视频论文探讨了一个关于动物福利的论点。为了本篇的目的，我将集中讨论被圈养的文化，并将其与蛇和蜥蜴联系起来。

English transcription of paragraph 2:
Let's begin. 
In 1963, Nico Tinbergen created a framework referred to as the "four whys." Tinbergen, while highlighting the complex and diverse behavior of animals, argued there were four questions that could be asked about animal behavior: 
1. How it develops (ontogeny).
2. How it helps an animal survive and reproduce.
3. How it changes over evolutionary time (phylogeny).
4. About the neural, hormonal, and other mechanisms underlying the behavior (the causation). 

Chinese translation of paragraph 2:
让我们开始。
1963年，Nico Tinbergen创建了一个被称为“四个为什么”的框架。在强调动物的复杂和多样性行为时，Tinbergen认为可以询问关于动物行为的四个问题：
1. 它如何发展（生殖发生）。
2. 它如何帮助动物生存和繁殖。
3. 它如何随着进化时间而变化（系统发生）。
4. 关于行为背后的神经、激素和其他机制（原因）。

English transcription of paragraph 3:
This approach has been widely used in the scientific approach to Animal Welfare. However, the widespread reliance upon "natural behavior" as a way of assessing Animal Welfare is argued to be outdated by Dawkins. Natural behavior is commonly defined as behaviors shown by animals living where their ancestors evolved or, at least, in man-made environments that allow them similar freedom of movement. The welfare of animals in zoos, farms, and in our case, people's homes, is then judged by the extent to which they too are able to show this natural behavior.

Chinese translation of paragraph 3:
这种方法已被广泛用于动物福利的科学研究。然而，Dawkins认为，过度依赖“自然行为”作为评估动物福利的方式是过时的。自然行为通常被定义为动物在其祖先进化的地方或至少在允许它们有类似移动自由的人造环境中表现出的行为。然后根据它们能够表现出这种自然行为的程度来判断动物园、农场和在我们的情况下，人们家中的动物的福利。

English transcription of paragraph 4:
Being able to perform natural behavior has come to define, for some, what good welfare means—an expression of animal essence or telos and how it evolved in its natural environment. But is there a more effective, evidence-based way to improve the lives of animals in captive culture? To answer that, we must turn to Tinbergen's four whys.

Chinese translation of paragraph 4:
对于一些人来说，能够表现出自然行为已经成为了定义什么是良好福利的标准——这是动物本质或终极目的的表达，以及它如何在其自然环境中进化。但是，有没有一种更有效、基于证据的方法来改善被圈养文化中动物的生活呢？为了回答这个问题，我们必须回到Tinbergen的四个为什么。

English transcription of paragraph 5:
The idea that most animal behavior is driven by instinctive urges has largely been discarded by the scientific community. It was based on a model by Conrad Lorenz, which argued that animals had a "motivational energy"—a drive associated with each behavior. When the behavior is performed, that energy is discharged. If the animal is prevented from performing the behavior, that energy builds up and may result in inappropriate and damaging behavior. Lorenz and others used this to argue that animals have behavioral needs essential for their welfare.

Chinese translation of paragraph 5:
科学界大多数已经放弃了动物行为大多受本能驱使的观念。这基于Conrad Lorenz的一个模型，他认为动物有一个“动机能量”——与每种行为相关的驱动力。当行为被执行时，那种能量被释放。如果阻止动物执行行为，那种能量会积累，可能导致不适当和有害的行为。Lorenz和其他人用这一观点来主张动物有行为需求，这对他们的福利至关重要。

English transcription of paragraph 6:
However, this model has been heavily criticized for its reliance on an unspecified "motivational energy" and a misunderstanding of real behavior. Despite this criticism, its influence persists, with many still believing animals are driven mainly by instinct. How many people believe that snakes are simple creatures driven only by instinct, requiring just food, water, warmth, and the opportunity to breed?

Chinese translation of paragraph 6:
然而，这一模型因过度依赖一个未明确的“动机能量”和对真实行为的误解而受到了严重的批评。尽管有这些批评，但它的影响仍然持续，许多人仍然相信动物主要受本能驱使。有多少人认为蛇只是简单的生物，只受本能驱使，只需要食物、水、温暖和繁殖的机会？

English transcription of paragraph 7:
Each behavior needs a unique understanding of its causation, development, and the consequences if an animal can't perform it. While natural behaviors, like defending against predators, are indicative of animals in the wild, they don't necessarily equate to good welfare. Natural behaviors, such as searching for food, might be indicative of poor conditions rather than an optimal state. Much of the behavior of wild animals can be seen as attempts to ward off adversity. Consequently, solely considering natural behavior is an unreliable metric for assessing an animal's welfare.

Chinese translation of paragraph 7:
每种行为都需要对其原因、发展和动物无法执行它时的后果进行独特的理解。尽管自然行为，如防御掠食者，是野生动物的标志，但它们不一定等同于良好的福利。自然行为，如寻找食物，可能更多地表明条件不佳，而不是最佳状态。大多数野生动物的行为可以被看作是努力抵御逆境的尝试。因此，仅考虑自然行为是评估动物福利的不可靠标准。

English transcription of paragraph 8:
Without supplementary evidence of what occurs if a behavior doesn't manifest, we cannot establish a clear link to welfare. Natural behavior, in isolation, lacks the essential indication of whether performing or not performing a behavior truly matters to the animal. Only by understanding what animals truly desire can we gauge their welfare effectively.

Chinese translation of paragraph 8:
如果没有行为未表现出来时的补充证据，我们无法建立与福利的明确联系。孤立地看，自然行为缺乏是否执行或不执行行为对动物真正重要的基本指标。只有通过了解动物真正的愿望，我们才能有效地衡量他们的福利。

English transcription of paragraph 9:
Animals' capacity to learn affords them more flexibility than if they merely followed a set of instinctive patterns. Prey comes in various forms, and by having innate preferences combined with learning, animals can adapt more effectively to changes in their environment. This adaptability allows them to exploit new resources not known to their ancestors, showing that much of animal behavior isn't just repetitive but is a delicate interplay between genes and environment.

Chinese translation of paragraph 9:
动物的学习能力使它们比单纯遵循一套本能模式更具灵活性。猎物有各种各样的形式，通过具有先天的偏好并结合学习，动物可以更有效地适应环境的变化。这种适应性使它们能够利用其祖先不知道的新资源，表明大部分动物的行为不仅仅是重复的，而是基因和环境之间的微妙互动。

English transcription of paragraph 10:
Far from being rigidly instinctive, most animal behavior is a nuanced interaction between genes and environment. Genes may dictate what an animal finds rewarding, but they don't prescribe specific behaviors to achieve these ends. Both an animal's surroundings and its experiences shape its actions. By understanding what animals find reinforcing and how motivated they are to seek certain outcomes, we have an objective way to gauge what they value. Emotions, integral to both humans and animals, shape these values, highlighting the importance of emotional well-being in assessing welfare.

Chinese translation of paragraph 10:
动物行为远非僵硬地受本能驱使，大多数动物行为是基因和环境之间的细致互动。基因可能决定动物发现什么是有奖励性的，但它们并不规定为达到这些目标而采取的具体行为。动物的周围环境和其经验都塑造了其行为。通过了解动物发现什么是加强性的以及他们有多大的动力寻求某些结果，我们有一个客观的方法来衡量它们的价值。情感对人和动物都是不可或缺的，塑造了这些价值观，强调了评估福利时情感健康的重要性。

Certainly, I'll provide a formal Chinese translation paragraph by paragraph:

---

**English transcription of paragraph 1:**
"Are you willing to work to obtain them? There is an objective way to know what they value. Rewards and punishments are at the heart of both human and animal emotion. Emotions are defined as states elicited by the presentation, termination, or omission of rewards and punishers. A positive emotion of pleasure might be elicited by receiving a reward such as food or warmth in reptiles, while negative emotions such as fear might be elicited by an impending punishment such as forced handling."

**Chinese translation of paragraph 1:**
"您是否愿意为之努力工作呢？有一种客观的方法可以知道他们重视什么。奖励和惩罚是人类和动物情感的核心。情感被定义为由奖励和惩罚的呈现、终止或省略引发的状态。例如，爬行动物收到如食物或温暖的奖励可能会引发积极的愉悦情感，而即将到来的惩罚，如强迫处理，可能会引发如恐惧之类的负面情感。"

---

**English transcription of paragraph 2:**
"This way of classifying emotions, whether they are positive or negative, is readily applicable to animal welfare science since good welfare can be seen as animals having predominantly positive emotions. This means that we should not be assessing welfare just by whether animals are showing natural behavior, but whether they are doing what they value, as seen by what they are willing to work for. Not all natural behaviors turn out to have the same value to an animal. To show an animal values something means showing that it will work for a reward; it will learn to perform some arbitrary action to obtain it."

**Chinese translation of paragraph 2:**
"这种分类情感的方式，无论是积极还是消极，都很适用于动物福利科学，因为良好的福利可以看作是动物主要拥有积极情感。这意味着我们不应该仅仅根据动物是否展示自然行为来评估福利，而是根据他们是否做他们看重的事情，如他们愿意为之工作的事情。并不是所有的自然行为对动物都有相同的价值。要证明动物重视某物意味着它会为奖励而工作; 它会学习执行某些任意行动来获得它。"

---

**English transcription of paragraph 3:**
"For example, hens in studies will peck a key to gain access to straw. Pigs, cows, and sheep will learn to operate switches for the reward of heat. King snakes will learn to turn a key for access to water. Burmese pythons will learn to press an illuminated button to gain access to food. There are many different ways to measure motivation. These include spatial distribution; the ways animals position themselves in their environments can be particularly useful for identifying what an animal wants when formal tests are simply not feasible."

**Chinese translation of paragraph 3:**
"例如，研究中的母鸡会啄一个键以获取稻草。猪、牛和羊将学习操作开关以获得热的奖励。王蛇会学习转动一个钥匙以获取水。缅甸蟒将学习按下一个发光的按钮以获得食物。有许多不同的方法来衡量动机。其中包括空间分布；动物在环境中的定位方式在正式测试不可行时特别有助于确定动物想要什么。"

---

**English transcription of paragraph 4:**
"For example, this raw python was seen repeatedly hanging off the wires in its environment. Its spatial distribution would suggest the animal desires more opportunity to climb or at least achieve height. This can be sensitive and reveal subtleties that more formal methods can miss. Time spent looking at spatial distribution over time gives an even clearer idea of what animals want, particularly if they move around and make repeated choices about where they want to be."

**Chinese translation of paragraph 4:**
"例如，这种原始的蟒蛇在其环境中被反复观察到挂在电线上。它的空间分布暗示动物可能希望有更多的机会攀爬或至少达到一定的高度。这种观察可能非常敏感，并揭示出更正式方法可能会遗漏的细微差别。花费时间观察长时间的空间分布可以更清楚地了解动物想要什么，特别是当它们移动并反复选择它们想要去的地方时。"

---

**English transcription of paragraph 5:**
"Measuring the amount of time animals spend on or near resources such as perches, hides, or basking areas is an easy, non-destructive way of seeing which ones they value by where they spend most of their time. It can also help rule out ones they do not value. Something cannot be classed as enrichment if the animal takes no notice or avoids it altogether. It can hardly be claimed they value it."

**Chinese translation of paragraph 5:**
"测量动物在栖息地、隐藏处或晒太阳区域等资源上或附近花费的时间是一种简单、非破坏性的方式，可以看出它们在哪里花费了大部分时间来判断它们重视哪些资源。这也可以帮助排除它们不重视的资源。如果动物没有注意到或完全避免某物，那么它不能被归类为丰富。很难说它们重视它。"

---

**English transcription of paragraph 6:**
"Approach/avoidance, another more structured way of assessing what an animal values, is to measure the speed of their approaching or moving away from something. Crawford and Holmes (1966) applied vibration stimulation to eight eastern mass snakes in a two-compartment chamber. Vibrations were applied to one chamber; the snakes could then move to the other chamber to escape the stimulus. With repetitions, they recorded a notable reduction in mean response times. This shows the species finds vibrations aversive and shows clear avoidance behavior, suggesting vivariums should not be placed near sources of vibrations, such as television sets."

**Chinese translation of paragraph 6:**
"接近/避免是另一种更有结构的评估动物价值观的方法，即测量它们接近或远离某物的速度。Crawford和Holmes（1966）对两个隔室中的八条东部质量蛇应用了振动刺激。一间隔室受到了振动，蛇则可以移动到另一间隔室以逃避刺激。经过重复实验，他们记录到明显的反应时间减少。这表明这个物种认为振动是令人反感的，并显示出明显的避免行为，这意味着活体展示柜不应放在如电视机这样的振动源附近。"

---

**English transcription of paragraph 7:**
"Choice tests can be conducted on a small scale, such as offering an animal a choice of two or more types of food, flooring, or types of building material. It can be impossible at times to use any of the previously mentioned methods to discover what an animal does or does not value because all methods require an animal to have multiple experiences so they can give an opinion on what is happening to it. When something happens only once, such as being caught or having a one-off medical procedure, it's not possible to see whether the experience results in a change of behavior, however negative or positive the experience might have been because there is no next-time condition to place preference or avoidance."

**Chinese translation of paragraph 7:**
"选择性测试可以在小范围内进行，例如为动物提供两种或更多类型的食物、地板或建筑材料的选择。有时使用前面提到的任何方法来发现动物所重视或不重视的东西可能是不可能的，因为所有的方法都要求动物有多次的经验，这样它们才能对正在发生的事情给出意见。当某事只发生一次，例如被捕捉或进行一次性的医疗程序时，就不可能看到这种经验是否导致行为的改变，因为没有下一次的条件来放置偏好或避免。"

---

**English transcription of paragraph 8:**
"Conditioned place preference or avoidance can be very useful methods as they involve training animals to associate one place with a particular experience, such as food or a loud noise, and another place with something completely different, usually when nothing happens. The animal's preference for being in one place or another is measured both before and after the experience has been investigated. If after a single experience there is a shift in where the animal chooses to spend its time, it suggests that it liked the experience and is trying to repeat it. Conversely, if it now avoids the place where the stimulus appeared and starts to prefer the place where it did not experience it, then this suggests it found the stimulus aversive and wants to get away from it."

**Chinese translation of paragraph 8:**
"条件性地点偏好或避免可以是非常有用的方法，因为它们涉及到训练动物将一个地方与某种特定的经验（例如食物或响声）联系起来，而另一个地方与完全不同的事物联系起来，通常是什么都没有发生。在经验被研究之前和之后都会测量动物在一个地方或另一个地方的偏好。如果在单一的经验之后，动物选择在哪里花费时间有了变化，这意味着它喜欢这种经验并试图重复它。相反，如果它现在避免了刺激出现的地方并开始偏好没有经历过的地方，那么这意味着它发现刺激是令人反感的并想要远离它。"

---

Absolutely, I'll finish translating the remaining paragraphs.

---

**English transcription of paragraph 9:**
"The advantage of this method is that it can work with just one experience provided the animal makes the association. Demonstrating what they find rewarding or punishing using operant conditioning is still the best test of what they value. The easiest way to distinguish a mechanism based on rewards and punishments from simpler mechanisms is to make the reward contingent on the animal making a completely arbitrary response, such as pressing down on a lever or turning around in a circle, and then seeing what the animal will learn to do the exact opposite, and push the lever upwards or circle in the other direction when the reward contingencies change."

**Chinese translation of paragraph 9:**
"这种方法的优点是只要动物建立了关联，它就可以通过单一的经验来工作。使用操作性条件作法来展示它们认为有奖励或有惩罚的事物仍然是测试它们所重视事物的最佳方法。区分基于奖励和惩罚的机制与更简单的机制的最简单的方法是使奖励取决于动物做出完全任意的反应，例如按下杆子或在圈中转圈，然后看动物学会做什么完全相反的事情，当奖励的条件发生变化时，它会向上推杆子或在另一个方向上转圈。"

---

**English transcription of paragraph 10:**
"If the animal can continuously update its behavior and do whatever it takes to get their reward, then clearly there is no fixed relationship between the stimulus and the response and we have correctly identified that its goal is obtaining the reward. Even if an animal will work for a reward, this does not complete the link to welfare. To do this, we need to know whether obtaining what is being approached, preferred, or worked for is actually what matters to the animal. In other words, we need to know not just what an animal wants but how much it wants it in comparison to something we know is already important to it, most obviously food."

**Chinese translation of paragraph 10:**
"如果动物能够不断更新其行为并做任何事情来获得奖励，那么明显地，刺激和反应之间没有固定的关系，我们已经正确地确定了它的目标是获得奖励。即使动物愿意为奖励而工作，这并不意味着与福利的联系已经建立。为了做到这一点，我们需要知道动物所接近、所偏好或为之工作的是否真的对动物来说是重要的。换句话说，我们不仅需要知道动物想要什么，而且要知道它与我们已知对其重要的事物，最明显的是食物，相比有多重视它。"

---
**English transcription of paragraph 1:**
Approached, preferred or worked for is actually what matters to the animal. In other words, we need to know not just what an animal wants, but how much it wants it in comparison to something we know is already important to it, most obviously, food. One way of doing this is to make it more difficult for an animal to access a reward and then see if it wants that reward so much they will overcome the difficulties and effectively pay a higher price for every reward. If it's prepared to pay an even higher price, and particularly if it's prepared to pay the same price as it would for food, then we have an objective measure of what it values. The way a price is paid can vary to suit the animal and the circumstances. To demonstrate what they value, animals have been willing to demonstrate in other studies that they're willing to squeeze through a narrow gap, walk down a long corridor, push a weighted door, walk through a water bath, run over an electric grid, be blasted with jet air, or simply repeatedly perform an ultimate response, such as pecking a key, not once but many times for a reward. The maximum price an animal is prepared to pay, in the face of these increasing difficulties, gives up and refuses to pay the price, can then be used as a measure of how much it values that reward. If the animal will pay as much for access to bedding material as it will pay for food, it is showing, at least in that moment, that it values bedding as much as food.

**Chinese translation of paragraph 1:**
接近、偏爱或为之努力的实际上是对动物真正重要的东西。换句话说，我们需要知道动物不仅想要什么，而且与我们已知对其重要的东西（最明显的是食物）相比，它有多么渴望它。一种方法是增加动物获取奖励的难度，然后观察它是否如此渴望那个奖励以至于会克服这些困难，并为每一个奖励有效地支付更高的代价。如果它准备支付更高的价格，特别是如果它准备支付与食物相同的价格，那么我们就有了一个客观的衡量其价值的标准。支付的方式可以根据动物和环境的情况进行调整。为了证明他们所珍视的，动物在其他研究中已经展示了他们愿意为了奖励而挤过狭窄的缝隙、走过长长的走廊、推开有重量的门、走过水浴、跑过电网、被喷射的气流吹风，或简单地反复执行一个终极反应，比如不止一次地啄键来获取奖励。动物在这些不断增加的困难面前准备支付的最大代价，放弃并拒绝支付这个价格，可以作为衡量它有多么珍视那个奖励的标准。如果动物愿意为获得铺床材料支付与食物相同的价格，那么至少在那一刻，它就表明它与食物一样珍视铺床材料。

**English transcription of paragraph 2:**
Natural behavior is behavior shown by wild or free-ranging members of a species that evolved as adaptations to the ancestral environment. Timber can argued that questions about adaptation could only be sensibly argued by studying animals in the natural habitat where doing or not doing the behavior could be demonstrated to make a difference in life or death. It might therefore seem irrelevant to ask the question about captive animals that are now in environments that are different from those in which their ancestors evolved and are largely protected from the hazards their wild ancestors faced. They have been selectively bred by humans, so that many look and behave differently from wild animals. It's important to understand where understanding the adaptive significance of behavior in wild species is important to welfare. It can help us understand why their descendants, living in a completely different man-made environment, can sometimes behave in ways that are harmful to themselves. Some people see the fact that animals do not always choose what's good for their health in the long run as a serious objection to using what animals value as a welfare metric. Animals, such as king snakes, may eat too much and become life-threateningly obese. This is because they're still valuing the rewards their ancestors did, but in the current captive environments, these rewards no longer align with what's best for health. Wild snakes often have to opportunistically eat when food is available, so overeats not knowing when the next meal is coming. The lesson here is to use what animals value in the here and now as an important part of their welfare but to realize that it's not the only measure of welfare that is important. They must be considered alongside physical health, as animals, like humans, do not always choose what's best for them in the long run. Animal welfare involves a balance between what is best for the long-term health and what's valued in the moment, just as it does with us humans.

**Chinese translation of paragraph 2:**
自然行为是指野生或自由活动的物种成员展示出的，作为对祖先环境适应而进化的行为。Timber认为，只有在动物的自然栖息地中研究动物，才能合理地讨论适应性问题，在那里做或不做行为可以证明在生死之间有所不同。因此，对现在处于与其祖先进化的环境不同，并且在很大程度上受到保护，免受其野生祖先所面临的危险的圈养动物提出这个问题可能看似不相关。它们已经被人类选择性地繁殖，因此许多动物的外观和行为与野生动物有所不同。理解野生物种行为的适应性意义对福利的重要性在哪里是很重要的。这可以帮助我们理解为什么他们的后代，在一个完全不同的人造环境中生活，有时会以对自己有害的方式行为。有

些人认为，动物不总是选择对其长期健康有益的东西，这是使用动物所珍视的东西作为福利衡量标准的一个严重的反对意见。比如说，王蛇可能吃得太多，变得危及生命的肥胖。这是因为它们仍然珍视其祖先所珍视的奖励，但在当前的圈养环境中，这些奖励不再与最有益于健康的东西一致。野生蛇经常在食物可得时机会性地进食，所以吃得过多，不知道下一顿饭何时到来。这里的教训是，使用动物在此时此刻所珍视的东西作为其福利的一个重要部分，但要认识到这并不是衡量福利的唯一标准。它们必须与身体健康一同考虑，因为动物，就像人类一样，不总是选择对它们长期有益的东西。动物福利涉及在长期健康和当下所珍视之间取得平衡，就像对我们人类一样。

**English transcription of paragraph 3:**
Timbogan's final question about the phylogeny of behavior is the least researched question in the context of natural behavior and welfare, but it deserves more attention than it gets. Tim Bergen himself was concerned with how behavior changes over time at the species level in a descendant and how it may be an exaggerated version of a successral species. Many of our domestic species are still the same species as their wild ancestor, but there have been major changes in their body shape, behavior, and other traits as shown by many different breeds that have been produced by artificial selection. 

**Chinese translation of paragraph 3:**
Timbogan关于行为谱系的最后一个问题，在自然行为和福利的背景下是研究得最少的问题，但它比实际得到的关注更值得关注。Tim Bergen本人关心的是，行为如何随着时间的推移在种属层面上发生变化，以及它如何可能是一个成功种的夸张版本。我们许多的家畜种类仍然与其野生祖先是同一种，但如许多不同品种所示，它们的体型、行为和其他特征都经历了人为选择所带来的重大变化。

**English transcription of paragraph 4:**
So let's bring this back to herps culture then. You may think of that as only being related to things we have truly domesticated, but we're artificially selecting for things in captivity; we just don't realize it. For example, some species of king snakes eat reptilian prey such as lizards and have a preference for lizards. Through captive breeding of these species, hatchlings that hatched out and wouldn't take rodent prey and subsequently died were selected against, which means the genes that were able to be proliferated were animals that were willing to eat mammalian prey. So, we've artificially selected for individuals that will eat rodents rather than lizards. Again, another example might be: you've got this snake that's really snappy, that's really defensive, that wants a lot of distance between you and it in its flight distance before it feels non-stressed, and it bites a lot. And you, as the keeper, are not really fond of that snake. So subconsciously, it's not your favorite. But you've got another snake that's really docile and really lovely, and you love that snake, so that's your main breeder. Well, what you're doing subconsciously is selecting against this snappy behavior and this defensiveness, and you're breeding for docility. You just don't realize you're doing it. So subconsciously, we're breeding for traits that we find desirable, and we're artificially selecting for and shifting things further away from what may be present and exhibited in the wild counterparts.

**Chinese translation of paragraph 4:**
那么，让我们再次回到爬虫文化吧。您可能认为这只与我们真正驯化的事物有关，但实际上我们正在圈养中选择某些事物；我们只是没有意识到它。例如，某些王蛇物种吃蜥蜴这样的爬行动物猎物，并且喜欢蜥蜴。通过这些物种的圈养繁殖，那些孵化出来但不吃啮齿动物猎物并随后死亡的幼体被选择性淘汰，这意味着能够繁殖的基因是那些愿意吃哺乳动

物猎物的动物。因此，我们已经选择性地繁殖了吃啮齿动物而不是蜥蜴的个体。再举一个例子：你有一条非常暴躁的蛇，它非常具有攻击性，想要在它感到没有压力之前在你和它之间保持很大的距离，而且经常咬人。作为饲养员，你并不真的喜欢那条蛇。所以在潜意识里，那不是你的最爱。但你又有另一条非常温顺又很可爱的蛇，你喜欢那条蛇，所以那是你的主要种蛇。那么，您在潜意识中所做的是选择反对这种暴躁的行为和这种防御性，并为温顺性繁殖。你只是没有意识到你正在这样做。因此，潜意识地，我们正在繁殖我们认为有吸引力的特性，并且我们正在选择性地繁殖，并将事物进一步远离可能在野生对应物中存在和展示的东西。

**English transcription of paragraph 5:**
One of the most important things we humans do is select for single traits, and then we find this leads to unforeseen problems. For example, selection for young adult high growth rate in broiler chickens has led to skeletal and other problems, including obesity in the adult birds. And these birds are now used for breeding, so they have to be feed restricted, which in itself is another welfare issue. Or how about the many neurological wobbles in multiple genes in ball pythons, obviously most notably in spiders, but it's in ...

**Chinese translation of paragraph 5:**
我们人类所做的最重要的事情之一是选择单一的特性，然后我们发现这导致了无法预见的问题。例如，选择肉鸡中的年轻成年鸡的高增长速度导致了骨骼和其他问题，包括成年鸟的肥胖。而这些鸟现在用于繁殖，所以它们必须受到喂食限制，这本身就是另一个福利问题。或者考虑球蟒中多个基因的许多神经性摇摆，显然最值得注意的是蜘蛛，但这也是...

**English transcription of paragraph 1:**
Problems include obesity in adult birds. These birds are now used for breeding, so they have to be feed-restricted, which in itself is another welfare issue. Or how about the many neurological wobbles in multiple genes and ball pythons? Most notably in spiders, but it's present in a lot of genes as well. There are behavioral traits associated with different genes. For example, champagne royal pythons are known for being more tweaky, more reactive, and more snappy than others of different morphs.

**Chinese translation of paragraph 1:**
成年鸟类的问题包括肥胖。这些鸟现在被用于繁殖，因此它们必须受到饲料限制，这本身就是另一个福利问题。或者，考虑在多个基因和球形蟒蛇中都存在的许多神经系统摇摆问题？最明显的是在蜘蛛中，但它也存在于很多基因中。有些行为特征与不同的基因有关。例如，香槟皇家蟒蛇因为比其他的不同形态更为活跃、更为敏感和更易激烈而为人所知。

**English transcription of paragraph 2:**
Natural selection, on the other hand, is multi-trait. Every change, such as an increase in growth rate, results in a net positive overall improvement in survival and reproduction. In nature, a bird that grew faster but could not walk or reproduce would be selected against. Only faster-growing individuals that could walk and produce offspring would contribute genetically to the next generation. However, in domestic environments, individuals that would not survive in the wild can not only be kept alive but also bred. Humans have selectively bred animals with traits that humans favor, such as fast growth rate, milk yield, or docility in snakes. This has been done usually with little regard or knowledge over other traits that have been selected for either as a byproduct or as the underlying mechanism.

**Chinese translation of paragraph 2:**
另一方面，自然选择是多重性状的。每一个变化，例如生长速度的增加，都会在生存和繁殖方面带来整体的净积极改进。在自然界中，一个生长得快但不能行走或繁殖的鸟会被选择性排除。只有能够行走并产下后代的快速生长的个体才会为下一代提供基因贡献。但是，在家养环境中，那些在野外无法生存的个体不仅可以维持生命，而且还可以繁殖。人类已选择性地培育出具有人类喜欢的特性的动物，如生长速度快、奶量大或蛇的驯良。这通常是在很少或没有其他因为副产品或基础机制而被选择的性状的考虑或知识的情况下进行的。

**English transcription of paragraph 3:**
For example, selecting chickens and pigs for a fast growth rate has involved changes to their anatomy and metabolism, affecting how much they eat, how hungry they become, and how well they can deal with heat stress, among other aspects of their bodies and behavior. We're only just beginning to understand how artificial selection has affected gene expression, brain structure, hormonal balance, and countless other traits. Understanding what we have done in the phylogeny of domestication is an important contribution to animal welfare. I propose that the same is happening in horticulture. How many single traits are we breeding for, but we don't understand what's going on with them? I suggest that we simply don't know what we're doing yet.

**Chinese translation of paragraph 3:**
例如，为了快速生长速度而选择鸡和猪涉及了它们的解剖和新陈代谢的变化，影响了它们吃的多少，它们有多饿，以及它们如何应对热应激等身体和行为的其他方面。我们才刚刚开始理解人为选择是如何影响基因表达、脑结构、激素平衡和无数其他性状的。理解我们在驯化系统发育中所做的事情对动物福利是一个重要的贡献。我提议在园艺中也发生着同样的事情。我们为了多少单一的特性而繁殖，但我们不了解它们的情况？我建议我们还不知道我们在做什么。

**English transcription of paragraph 4:**
Natural behavior, in terms of what their wild counterparts would do in the wild, can be a good indication. It's probable that captive snakes value this too, but it's not absolute. It merely allows us to produce a hypothesis. For instance, there are papers on Eastern black king snakes showing that they have preferred den sites around a habitat, and they prefer deep leaf litter. I can make the logical assumption that I should provide my Eastern black king snakes with deep leaf litter. However, I've made an assumption. The hypothesis is that they likely value leaf litter because their wild counterpart does. Therefore, we can test this by assessing how much they're willing to work for that leaf litter and by comparing that to other things like food. We can see how much they value that. So there's a framework being built now on how we can truly understand what these animals want and elevate the standards of animal welfare.

**Chinese translation of paragraph 4:**
从野生对应体在野外所做的自然行为来看，可以作为一个很好的指示。很有可能家养的蛇也重视这一点，但这并不是绝对的。这只是让我们产生一个假设。例如，有关于东方黑王蛇的论文显示，它们在栖息地周围有首选的巢穴地点，并且它们更喜欢深叶屑。我可以逻辑地假设我应该为我的东方黑王蛇提供深叶屑。但是，我已经做出

了一个假设。这个假设是，它们可能重视叶屑，因为它们的野生对应体也这么做。因此，我们可以通过评估它们为那叶屑付出多少努力，并将其与其他如食物等东西进行比较，来测试这一点。我们可以看到它们多么重视那个。因此，现在正在建立一个框架，如何真正了解这些动物想要什么，并提高动物福利的标准。

**English transcription of paragraph 5:**
There's a framework based on using natural behavior and building hypotheses, but there's also a framework for focal husbandry and using that to build hypotheses as well. So, what if there's a larger philosophy and a rigid framework that provides a solid approach to horticulture? That, my friends, is the subject of another video essay.

**Chinese translation of paragraph 5:**
基于使用自然行为并建立假设的有一个框架，但也有一个针对焦点畜牧业并使用它来建立假设的框架。那么，如果有一个更大的哲学和一个严格的框架为园艺提供了坚实的方法呢？这，我的朋友们，是另一个视频随笔的主题。

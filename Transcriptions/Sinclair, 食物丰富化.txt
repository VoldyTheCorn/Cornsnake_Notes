The English version:

Insect-eating lizards and some snake species emphasize the importance of variety in their diet, trying to offer as many different types of insect feeders as possible. We understand that these animals would find a vast variety of food items in the wild, and we do our best to emulate that in captivity. However, when the same is true for snakes in the wild, many keepers maintain snakes on a monocultured diet of mice or rats, even though we have much more available to us to feed our snakes. The question then arises: what else can we feed our snakes?

The Chinese version:

昆虫食性的蜥蜴和某些蛇类强调饮食多样性的重要性，尽可能提供多种不同类型的昆虫饲料。我们理解这些动物在野外会找到各种各样的食物，我们在圈养中尽力模拟这种情况。然而，当野生蛇类也是如此时，许多饲养者仍然只用老鼠或大鼠来喂养蛇，尽管我们有更多的食物可以供蛇食用。那么问题来了：我们还可以喂什么给我们的蛇？如果你想跟上基于科学的爬行动物护理的最新信息，那么请点击订阅按钮，并按下未来信息的铃铛图标。

The English version:

The most important thing for us to start on is why do we need to feed more than just mice or rats. The answer to that is, to best keep an animal in captivity, we must carefully consider and understand its natural history. So, what do our pets eat in the wild? Yes, I know that's a very broad question, but luckily for us, there is scientific data out there. This data not only provides information on what has been eaten, but also on what percentage of the diet is mammal, bird, or reptile, etc.

The Chinese version:

我们需要首先考虑的最重要的问题是，为什么我们需要喂养的食物不仅仅是老鼠或大鼠。答案是，要想最好地饲养动物，我们必须仔细考虑并理解其自然历史。那么，我们的宠物在野外吃什么呢？是的，我知道这是一个很宽泛的问题，但幸运的是，我们有科学数据可以参考。这些数据不仅提供了哪些食物被吃掉的信息，还提供了饮食中哪一部分是哺乳动物、鸟类或爬行动物等的比例。

The English version:

We often see people keep a royal python on rats orders for its adult life when in reality, this doesn't reflect their natural history at all. There are scientific papers on royal pythons' wild diets out there, and the results may be far from what you'd expect. For example, a study on sexual dimorphism in royal pythons found differences in diets between the sexes. These results were found by fecal examination and forced regurgitation of stomach contents. Snakes smaller than 70 centimeters, or just over two feet, almost exclusively fed on small birds i.e., nestlings or immature birds. Both sexes fed exclusively on birds and mammals, with a significant difference between the sexes. Birds made up to 70.2% of the male's diets. Yes, that's right, 70% of the diet of a male world python is birds. And then on the flip side, females' diets were made up of 66.7% mammals. When individuals over 100 centimeters are concerned, the diet is almost exclusively small mammals.

The Chinese version:

我们经常看到人们让皇家蟒蛇在其成年生活中以鼠类为食，但实际上，这并不能反映其自然历史。有关皇家蟒蛇野生饮食的科学论文很多，结果可能远非你所期待的。例如，一项关于皇家蟒蛇性二型性的研究发现，性别间的饮食存在差异。这些结果是通过粪便检查和强制胃内容物反刍得出的。小于70厘米或刚过两英尺的蛇几乎只吃小鸟，即雏鸟或未成熟的鸟。两性都只吃鸟类和哺乳动物，其中性别间存在显著差异。鸟类占了雄性饮食的70.2%。是的，你没听错，雄性世界蟒蛇的饮食中有70%是鸟类。而在另一方面，雌性的饮食由66.7%的哺乳动物组成。当涉及到超过100厘米的个体时，饮食几乎完全是小型哺乳动物。

The English version:

This study also identified what the prey item was down to the species level if possible. In this table, they listed what they found with the bird portion of the diet: Turdus sp, Columbidae sp, Sitticus erythrus, Moropidae, Sylvidae, Nectariniidae, Sternidae, Ploceidae. And then their mammal portion of the diet: Crocidura sp, Aperaforus, Megaloglossus romani, Cricetomys gambianus, Pyomys tobii, Muridae, Lemniscomys striatus, Protoxerus stangeri. This is literally only what's been eaten at the time of study. We really don't know how diverse the diet actually is, but one thing we can be 100% sure on is that the diet is not made up of a single species.

The Chinese version:

这项研究还尽可能地确定了猎物种类到物种级别。在这张表格中，他们列出了他们在鸟类部分饮食中发现的物种：鸫科，鸽科，跳蛛科，鹀科，莺科，花蜜鸟科，燕科，织巢鸟科。然后是他们的哺乳动物部分的饮食：白鼠科，蝙蝠科，大舌蝠科，甘比亚鼠科，托比鼠科，鼠科，条纹鼠科，巨松鼠科。这只是在研究期间被吃掉的食物。我们真的不知道饮食实际上有多么多样化，但我们可以百分之百确定的一点是，饮食不是由单一物种组成的。

The English version:

If we take a look at this paper on the suitability of day-old chicks for snakes, we find a table of the taxonomic composition of wild diets of commonly kept snake species and a reference to the original papers per species. I'm not going to read out the entire table, but I will pick up some interesting pieces. Boa constrictor diets were mostly birds and reptiles, with only a quarter of the diet being mammals. Lampropeltis getula, to which the Californian and Mexican black king snake subspecies belong, had a diet of 60% reptiles, 12% birds, and only 27% mammals. Corn snakes eat 64% mammals, 22% birds, 10% reptiles, and 4% amphibians. I think you get the picture now, nothing eats a solely single-species diet.

The Chinese version:

如果我们看一下这篇关于一日龄鸡对蛇类适宜性的论文，我们会找到一张表格，列出了常见饲养蛇类的野生饮食的分类组成，并参考了每种物种的原始论文。我不打算阅读整张表格，但我会挑出一些有趣的部分。蟒蛇的饮食主要是鸟类和爬行动物，哺乳动物只占饮食的四分之一。拉姆鲁贝尔特蛇，包括加利福尼亚和墨西哥黑皇蛇亚种，饮食中60%是爬行动物，12%是鸟类，只有27%是哺乳动物。玉米蛇吃64%的哺乳动物，22%的鸟类，10%的爬行动物和4%的两栖动物。我想你现在明白了，没有什么是只吃单一物种的。

The English version:

So, how do we as snake keepers diversify our pets' diets? Lots of things are available frozen-thawed now in the UK quite easily. I don't have any experience about what is available in the US, so I cannot speak for that. But you can now find the following frozen-thawed in the UK: mice, rats, multimammates or African soft furs, gerbils, hamsters, quails, quail eggs, day-old chicks, chickens, rabbits, guinea pigs. You can get quail eggs from supermarkets, frozen lizards or snakes if you ask a reptile shop or a friend who has some stock. You can get frog's legs online, and there are various fish species available.

The Chinese version:

那么，作为蛇类饲养者，我们如何使我们的宠物的饮食多样化呢？在英国，现在很多东西都可以很容易地冷冻解冻。我不知道在美国有什么可用的，所以我不能发言。但是现在你可以在英国找到以下冷冻解冻的食物：老鼠，大鼠，多哺乳动物或非洲软毛动物，沙鼠，仓鼠，鹌鹑，鹌鹑蛋，一日龄鸡，鸡，兔子，豚鼠。你可以在超市买到鹌鹑蛋，如果你问爬行动物店或一个有库存的朋友，你可以得到冷冻的蜥蜴或蛇。你可以在线购买青蛙腿，还有各种鱼类可供选择。

The English version:

There's also this idea that a snake must be fed at the same time between every meal, which isn't the case. Varying the food item size, type, and duration between feeds is both enriching and more natural. With my own personal snakes, I may feed a meal after 14 days, or I may feed two smaller meals in shorter succession. I may feed a large amount and then not feed for another month. When my king snake ate a corn snake, she wasn't fed for another 41 days. I may feed a handful of rat pups or a few quail eggs to simulate nest raiding. With the frozen frog's legs, you can get them in the UK from King Crab. You can buy one kilo's worth of frozen-thawed frog's legs for nine pounds fifty. This isn't a whole prey.

The Chinese version:

还有一种观点是，每次喂食之间，蛇必须在同一时间喂食，但实际情况并非如此。改变食物的大小、类型和喂食间隔的时间既丰富又更自然。对于我自己的蛇，我可能在14天后喂一顿，或者我可能在较短的时间内喂两顿较小的食物。我可能喂很多，然后一个月都不喂。当我的皇蛇吃了一只玉米蛇后，她又过了41天才被喂食。我可能喂一把老鼠幼崽或几个鹌鹑蛋以模拟窝巢掠夺。对于冷冻的青蛙腿，你可以在英国的King Crab买到。你可以用九镑五十买到一公斤的冷冻解冻的青蛙腿。这并不是整个猎物。

Role: assistant
English Version: A handful of rat pups or a few quail eggs can be used to simulate nest raiding. With frozen frog legs, which you can get in the UK from King Crab Cody UK, you can buy one kilo's worth of frozen thawed frog's legs for nine pounds fifty. This isn't a whole prey item, but it adds variety to the diet that would otherwise be absent.

Chinese Version: 一小撮老鼠幼崽或几个鹌鹑蛋可以模拟捕食巢穴的情景。在英国，你可以从King Crab Cody UK购买一公斤冻蛙腿，价格为9英镑50便士。虽然这不是完整的猎物，但它能为饮食增添一些原本缺失的多样性。

English Version: What I like to do personally is say I buy 10 large mice in a pack of ten, I might buy 10 chicks in a pack of 10. On every second or other feed, I will go to the reptile shop and buy a singular item for that exact feed, whether that's a hamster, a quail, or a snake.

Chinese Version: 我个人喜欢的做法是，假设我买了一包十只大老鼠，我可能会再买一包十只小鸡。在每次喂食或其他喂食时，我会去爬行动物店购买一种单一的食物，无论是仓鼠、鹌鹑还是蛇。

English Version: Whatever the main food item you're currently using, you can still buy that in bulk and frame adding other items to the diet around that baseline feeder.

Chinese Version: 无论你当前主要使用的是什么食物，你都可以批量购买，并在这个基线食物周围添加其他食物。

English Version: I think we owe it to our animals to do our very best. Yes, we may not be able to entirely replicate their exact wild diet, but even including a few more new prey items and slowly expanding the diet as you go is better than nothing.

Chinese Version: 我认为我们应当尽我们所能来喂养我们的动物。是的，我们可能无法完全复制它们在野外的精确饮食，但即使加入一些新的猎物，并在喂养过程中慢慢扩大饮食范围，总比什么都不做好。

English Version: Some people are so set feeding the snake the exact same size meal in the same way after the same amount of days. I promise you, varying prey type is not going to harm the snake.

Chinese Version: 有些人总是在相同的天数后，以相同的方式喂蛇相同大小的食物。我向你保证，改变猎物类型不会对蛇造成伤害。

English Version: And I know what some people say, "This snake is a tricky feeder, I'm not gonna deviate from my diet." Well, fair enough, I say. Does that snake have EVB? Does that snack have near-infrared heat sources?

Chinese Version: 我知道有些人会说，“这条蛇很挑食，我不打算改变我的饮食。”那么，我说，这合理吗？那条蛇有紫外线B吗？那种零食有近红外热源吗？

English Version: I truly believe some of the pickiness and behavioral issues we find of our snakes are down to our own misunderstanding of the natural history of the species we keep and of course our own actions lead to issues.

Chinese Version: 我真心相信，我们在蛇身上发现的一些挑食和行为问题，主要是由于我们对所养种类的自然历史的误解，当然，我们自己的行为也会导致问题。

English Version: For example, people found out nearly half a century ago that if he gave a snake UVB and that snake was a non-feeder, it would re-initiate with feeding after being given UVB.

Chinese Version: 例如，人们大约在半个世纪前发现，如果给蛇提供紫外线B，那么即使那条蛇原本不吃食，也会在接受紫外线B照射后重新开始进食。

English Version: And if you think that's ridiculous, snakes don't need UVB, click the video on the left for my video explaining exactly why snakes need UVB. I back that up with multiple studies.

Chinese Version: 如果你认为这很荒谬，蛇不需要紫外线B，那么请点击左边的视频，观看我解释蛇为什么需要紫外线B的视频。我有多项研究作为支持。

English Version: And if you found this type of video interesting, click on the playlist on the right for other reptile channels I recommend. Honestly, you'll be amazed at what some of the things people are up to.

Chinese Version: 如果你觉得这类视频有趣，可以点击右边的播放列表，查看我推荐的其他爬行动物频道。真的，有些人正在做的事情会让你大吃一惊。
